In prehistoric Greece Crete Mycenae existed system high status apiculture concluded finds hives smoking pots honey extractors beekeeping paraphernalia Knossos
Beekeeping considered highly valued industry controlled beekeeping overseers owners gold rings depicting apiculture scenes rather religious ones reinterpreted recently contra Sir Arthur Evans Archaeological finds relating beekeeping discovered Rehov Bronze Iron Age archaeological site Jordan Valley Israel
Thirty intact hives made straw unbaked clay discovered archaeologist Amihai Mazar ruins city dating BCE
The hives found orderly rows three high manner could accommodated around hives held million bees potential annual yield kilograms honey kilograms beeswax according Mazar evidence advanced honey industry existed ancient Israel years ago
In ancient Greece aspects lives bees beekeeping discussed length Aristotle
Beekeeping also documented Roman writers Virgil Gaius Julius Hyginus Varro Columella
Beekeeping also practiced ancient China since antiquity
In book Golden Rules Business Success written Fan Li Tao Zhu Gong Spring Autumn period sections describing art beekeeping stressing importance quality wooden box used affect quality honey
The Chinese word honey 蜜 mì reconstructed Old Chinese pronunciation mjit borrowed Indo European proto Tocharian language source honey proto Tocharian ḿət ə ḿ palatalized cf

The ancient Maya domesticated separate species stingless bee
The use stingless bees referred meliponiculture named bees tribe Meliponini Melipona quadrifasciata Brazil
This variation bee keeping still occurs around world today
For instance Australia stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria kept production honey
Scientific study honey bees It th century European natural philosophers undertook scientific study bee colonies began understand complex hidden world bee biology
Preeminent among scientific pioneers Swammerdam René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur Charles Bonnet François Huber
Swammerdam Réaumur among first use microscope dissection understand internal biology honey bees
Réaumur among first construct glass walled observation hive better observe activities within hives
He observed queens laying eggs open cells still idea queen fertilized nobody ever witnessed mating queen drone many theories held queens self fertile others believed vapor miasma emanating drones fertilized queens without direct physical contact
Huber first prove observation experiment queens physically inseminated drones outside confines hives usually great distance away
Following Réaumur design Huber built improved glass walled observation hives sectional hives could opened like leaves book
This allowed inspecting individual wax combs greatly improved direct observation hive activity
Although went blind twenty Huber employed secretary François Burnens make daily observations conduct careful experiments keep accurate notes twenty years
Huber confirmed hive consists one queen mother female workers male drones colony
He also first confirm mating drones takes place outside hives queens inseminated number successive matings male drones high air great distance hive
Together Burnens dissected bees microscope among first describe ovaries spermatheca sperm store queens well penis male drones
Huber universally regarded father modern bee science Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles New Observations Bees revealed basic scientific truths biology ecology honeybees
Invention movable comb hive Early forms honey collecting entailed destruction entire colony honey harvested
The wild hive crudely broken using smoke suppress bees honeycombs torn smashed along eggs larvae honey contained
The liquid honey destroyed brood nest strained sieve basket
This destructive unhygienic hunter gatherer societies matter since honey generally consumed immediately always wild colonies exploit
But settled societies destruction bee colony meant loss valuable resource drawback made beekeeping inefficient something stop start activity
There could continuity production possibility selective breeding since bee colony destroyed harvest time along precious queen
During medieval period abbeys monasteries centers beekeeping since beeswax highly prized candles fermented honey used make alcoholic mead areas Europe vines would grow
The th th centuries saw successive stages revolution beekeeping allowed bees preserved taking harvest
Intermediate stages transition old beekeeping new recorded example Thomas Wildman described advances destructive old skep based beekeeping bees longer killed harvest honey
Wildman example fixed parallel array wooden bars across top straw hive skep separate straw top fixed later seven bars deal inch diameter mm hive bees fix combs
He also described using hives multi storey configuration foreshadowing modern use supers described adding proper time successive straw hives eventually removing ones free brood filled honey bees could separately preserved harvest following season
Wildman also described development using hives sliding frames bees build comb foreshadowing modern uses movable comb hives
Wildman book acknowledged advances knowledge bees previously made Swammerdam Maraldi de Réaumur included lengthy translation Réaumur account natural history bees also described initiatives others designing hives preservation bee life taking harvest citing particular reports Brittany dating due Comte de la Bourdonnaye
However forerunners modern hives movable frames mainly used today considered traditional basket top bar movable comb hives Greece known Greek beehives
The oldest testimony use dates back although probable use years old
The th century saw revolution beekeeping practice completed perfection movable comb hive American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth
Langstroth first person make practical use Huber earlier discovery specific spatial measurement wax combs later called bee space bees block wax keep free passage
Having determined bee space mm Langstroth designed series wooden frames within rectangular hive box carefully maintaining correct space successive frames found bees would build parallel honeycombs box without bonding hive walls
This enables beekeeper slide frame hive inspection without harming bees comb protecting eggs larvae pupae contained within cells
It also meant combs containing honey could gently removed honey extracted without destroying comb
The emptied honey combs could returned bees intact refilling
Langstroth book The Hive Honey bee published described rediscovery bee space development patent movable comb hive
The invention development movable comb hive fostered growth commercial honey production large scale Europe US see also Beekeeping United States
Evolution hive designs Langstroth design movable comb hives seized upon apiarists inventors sides Atlantic wide range moveable comb hives designed perfected England France Germany United States
Classic designs evolved country Dadant hives Langstroth hives still dominant US France De Layens trough hive became popular UK British National hive became standard late although Scotland smaller Smith hive still popular
In Scandinavian countries Russia traditional trough hive persisted late th century still kept areas
However Langstroth Dadant designs remain ubiquitous US also many parts Europe though Sweden Denmark Germany France Italy national hive designs
Regional variations hive evolved reflect climate floral productivity reproductive characteristics various subspecies native honey bee bio region
The differences hive dimensions insignificant comparison common factors hives square rectangular use movable wooden frames consist floor brood box honey super crown board roof
Hives traditionally constructed cedar pine cypress wood recent years hives made injection molded dense polystyrene become increasingly important
Hives also use queen excluders brood box honey supers keep queen laying eggs cells next containing honey intended consumption
Also advent th century mite pests hive floors often replaced part whole year wire mesh removable tray
In Flow Hive system invented Australia Cedar Anderson father Stuart Anderson allowing honey extracted without expensive centrifuge equipment
Pioneers practical commercial beekeeping The th century produced explosion innovators inventors perfected design production beehives systems management husbandry stock improvement selective breeding honey extraction marketing
Preeminent among innovators Petro Prokopovych used frames channels side woodwork packed side side boxes stacked one top
The bees traveled frame frame box box via channels

Traditional beekeeping Fixed comb hives A fixed comb hive hive combs cannot removed manipulated management harvesting without permanently damaging comb
Almost hollow structure used purpose log gum skep wooden box clay pot tube
Fixed comb hives longer common use industrialized countries illegal places require movable combs inspect problems varroa American foulbrood
In many developing countries fixed comb hives widely used made locally available material
Beekeeping using fixed comb hives essential part livelihoods many communities poor countries
The charity Bees Development recognizes local skills manage bees fixed comb hives widespread Africa Asia South America
Internal size fixed comb hives range liters cubic inches typical clay tube hives used Egypt liters cubic inches Perone hive
Straw skeps bee gums unframed box hives unlawful US states comb brood cannot inspected diseases
However skeps still used collecting swarms hobbyists UK moving standard hives
Quinby used box hives produce much honey saturated New York market
His writings contain excellent advice management bees fixed comb hives
Modern beekeeping Topbar hives Top bar hives widely adopted Africa used keep tropical honeybee ecotypes
Their advantages include light weight adaptable easy harvest honey less stressful bees
Disadvantages include combs fragile cannot usually extracted returned bees refilled cannot easily expanded additional honey storage
A growing number amateur beekeepers adopting various top bar hives similar type commonly found Africa
Top bar hives originally used traditional beekeeping method Greece Vietnam history dating back years
These hives frames honey filled comb returned extraction
Because production honey likely somewhat less frame super based hive Langstroth Dadant
Top bar hives mostly kept people interested bees garden honey production per se
Some well known top bar hive designs Kenyan Top Bar Hive sloping sides Tanzanian Top Bar Hive straight sides Vertical Top Bar Hives Warre People Hive designed Abbe Warre mid
The initial costs equipment requirements typically much less hive designs
Scrap wood pine often used build nice hive
Top bar hives also offer advantages interacting bees amount weight must lifted greatly reduced
Top bar hives widely used developing countries Africa Asia result Bees Development program
Since growing number beekeepers U S using various top bar hives
Vertical stackable hives There three types vertical stackable hives hanging top access frame sliding side access frame top bar
Hanging frame hives include Langstroth British National Dadant Layens Rose differing primarily size number frames
The Langstroth first successful top opened hive movable frames
Many hive designs based principle bee space first described Langstroth descendant Jan Dzierzon Polish hive designs
Langstroth hives common size United States much world British National common size United Kingdom Dadant Modified Dadant hives widely used France Italy Layens beekeepers large size advantage
Square Dadant hives often called frame Dadant Brother Adam hives used large parts Germany parts Europe commercial beekeepers
Any hanging frame hive design built sliding frame design
The AZ Hive original sliding frame design integrates hives using Langstroth sized frames honey house streamline workflow honey harvest localization labor similar cellular manufacturing
The honey house portable trailer allowing beekeeper haul hives site provide pollination services
Top bar stackable hives simply use top bars instead full frames
The common type Warre hive although hive hanging frames made top bar stackable hive using top bar whole frame
This may work less well larger frames crosscomb attachment occur readily
Protective clothing Most beekeepers also wear protective clothing
Novice beekeepers usually wear gloves hooded suit hat veil
Experienced beekeepers sometimes elect use gloves inhibit delicate manipulations
The face neck important areas protect beekeepers wear least veil
Defensive bees attracted breath sting face lead much pain swelling sting elsewhere sting bare hand usually quickly removed fingernail scrape reduce amount venom injected
Traditionally beekeeping clothing pale colored still common today
This natural color cotton cost coloring expense warranted workwear though consider provide better differentiation colony natural predators bears skunks tend dark colored
It known bees see ultraviolet also attracted scent
So type fabric conditioner used impact color fabric
https news ncsu edu wms bees see https blogs scientificamerican com guest blog well ill bee bees see uv Stings retained clothing fabric continue pump alarm pheromone attracts aggressive action stinging attacks
Washing suits regularly rinsing gloved hands vinegar minimizes attraction
Smoker Smoke beekeeper third line defense
Most beekeepers use smoker device designed generate smoke incomplete combustion various fuels
Smoke calms bees initiates feeding response anticipation possible hive abandonment due fire
Smoke also masks alarm pheromones released guard bees bees squashed inspection
The ensuing confusion creates opportunity beekeeper open hive work without triggering defensive reaction
In addition bee consumes honey bee abdomen distends supposedly making difficult make necessary flexes sting though tested scientifically
Many types fuel used smoker long natural contaminated harmful substances
These fuels include hessian twine burlap pine needles corrugated cardboard mostly rotten punky wood
Indian beekeepers especially Kerala often use coconut fibers readily available safe negligible expense
Some beekeeping supply sources also sell commercial fuels like pulped paper compressed cotton even aerosol cans smoke
Other beekeepers use sumac fuel ejects lots smoke odor
Some beekeepers using liquid smoke safer convenient alternative
It water based solution sprayed onto bees plastic spray bottle
Torpor may also induced introduction chilled air hive chilled carbon dioxide may harmful long term effects
Effects stings protective measures Some beekeepers believe stings beekeeper receives less irritation causes consider important safety beekeeper stung times season
Beekeepers high levels antibodies mainly IgG reacting major antigen bee venom phospholipase A PLA
Antibodies correlate frequency bee stings
The entry venom body bee stings may also hindered reduced protective clothing allows wearer remove stings venom sacs simple tug clothing
Although stinger barbed worker bee less likely become lodged clothing human skin
If beekeeper stung bee many protective measures taken order make sure affected area become irritated
The first cautionary step taken following bee sting removing stinger without squeezing attached venom glands
A quick scrape fingernail effective intuitive
This step effective making sure venom injected spread side effects sting go away sooner
Washing affected area soap water also good way stop spread venom
The last step needs taken apply ice cold compress stung area
Natural beekeeping The natural beekeeping movement believes bee hives weakened modern beekeeping agricultural practices crop spraying hive movement frequent hive inspections artificial insemination queens routine medication sugar water feeding Practitioners natural beekeeping tend use variations top bar hive simple design retains concept movable comb without use frames foundation
The horizontal top bar hive championed Marty Hardison Michael Bush Philip Chandler Dennis Murrell others seen modernization hollow log hives addition wooden bars specific width bees hang combs
Its widespread adoption recent years attributed publication The Barefoot Beekeeper Philip Chandler challenged many aspects modern beekeeping offered horizontal top bar hive viable alternative ubiquitous Langstroth style movable frame hive
The popular vertical top bar hive Warré hive based design French priest Abbé Émile Warré popularized Dr David Heaf English translation Warré book L Apiculture pour Tous Beekeeping For All
Urban backyard beekeeping Related natural beekeeping urban beekeeping attempt revert less industrialized way obtaining honey utilizing small scale colonies pollinate urban gardens
Urban apiculture undergone renaissance first decade st century urban beekeeping seen many growing trend Some found city bees actually healthier rural bees fewer pesticides greater biodiversity urban gardens
Urban bees may fail find forage however homeowners use landscapes help feed local bee populations planting flowers provide nectar pollen
An environment year round uninterrupted bloom creates ideal environment colony reproduction Urban beekeepers testing modern types beehives testing urban contest ease use
In FlowHive appeared Beeing hive made Italy allows beekeeper extract honey without contact bees
Indoor beekeeping Modern beekeepers experimented raising bees indoors controlled environment indoor observation hives
This may done reasons space monitoring season
In season large commercial beekeepers may move colonies wintering warehouses fixed temperature light humidity
This helps bees remain healthy relatively dormant
These relatively dormant wintered bees survive stored honey new bees born Experiments raising bees longer durations indoors looked detailed varying environment controls
In MIT Synthetic Apiary project simulated springtime inside closed environment number hives course winter
They provided food sources simulated long days saw activity reproduction levels comparable levels seen outdoors warm weather
They concluded indoor apiary could sustained year round needed

This species several sub species regional varieties Italian bee Apis mellifera ligustica European dark bee Apis mellifera mellifera Carniolan honey bee Apis mellifera carnica
In tropics species social bees managed honey production including Asiatic honey bee Apis cerana
Castes A colony bees consists three castes bee queen bee normally breeding female colony large number female worker bees typically number number male drones ranging thousands strong hive spring dearth cold season
The queen sexually mature female hive female worker bees male drones offspring
The queen may live three years may capable laying half million eggs lifetime
At peak breeding season late spring summer good queen may capable laying eggs one day body weight
This would exceptional however prolific queen might peak eggs day average queen might lay eggs per day
The queen raised normal worker egg fed larger amount royal jelly normal worker bee resulting radically different growth metamorphosis
The queen influences colony production dissemination variety pheromones queen substances
One chemicals suppresses development ovaries female worker bees hive prevents laying eggs
Mating queens The queen emerges cell days development remains hive days venturing mating flight
Mating flight otherwise known nuptial flight
Her first orientation flight may last seconds enough mark position hive
Subsequent mating flights may last minutes minutes may mate number male drones flight
Over several matings possibly dozen queen receives stores enough sperm succession drones fertilize hundreds thousands eggs
If manage leave hive mate possibly due bad weather trapped part hive remains infertile becomes drone layer incapable producing female worker bees
Worker bees sometimes kill non performing queen produce another
Without properly performing queen hive doomed
Mating takes place distance hive often several hundred feet air thought separates strongest drones weaker ones ensuring fastest strongest drones get pass genes
Worker bees Most bees hive female worker bees
At height summer activity hive frantic work goes non stop life worker bee may short weeks late autumn brood raised nectar harvested young bee may live weeks right winter
Over course lives worker bees duties dictated age
For first weeks lifespan perform basic chores within hive cleaning empty brood cells removing debris housekeeping tasks making wax building repairing comb feeding larvae
Later may ventilate hive guard entrance
Older workers leave hive daily weather permitting forage nectar pollen water propolis
Drones Drones largest bees hive except queen almost twice size worker bee
Note picture much larger eyes workers presumably better locate queen mating flight
They work forage pollen nectar unable sting known function mate new queens fertilize mating flights
A bee colony generally starts raise drones weeks building queen cells supersede failing queen prepare swarming
When queen raising season bees colder climates drive drones hive die biting tearing legs wings
Differing stages development Structure bee colony A domesticated bee colony normally housed rectangular hive body within eight ten parallel frames house vertical plates honeycomb contain eggs larvae pupae food colony
If one cut vertical cross section hive side side brood nest would appear roughly ovoid ball spanning frames comb
The two outside combs side hive tend exclusively used long term storage honey pollen
Within central brood nest single frame comb typically central disk eggs larvae sealed brood cells may extend almost edges frame
Immediately brood patch arch pollen filled cells extends side side broader arch honey filled cells extends frame tops
The pollen protein rich food developing larvae honey also food largely energy rich rather protein rich
The nurse bees care developing brood secrete special food called royal jelly feeding honey pollen
The amount royal jelly fed larva determines whether develops worker bee queen
Apart honey stored within central brood frames bees store surplus honey combs brood nest
In modern hives beekeeper places separate boxes called supers brood box series shallower combs provided storage honey
This enables beekeeper remove supers late summer extract surplus honey harvest without damaging colony bees brood nest
If honey taken including amount honey needed survive winter beekeeper must replace stores feeding bees sugar corn syrup autumn
Annual cycle bee colony The development bee colony follows annual cycle growth begins spring rapid expansion brood nest soon pollen available feeding larvae
Some production brood may begin early January even cold winter breeding accelerates towards peak May northern hemisphere producing abundance harvesting bees synchronized main nectar flow region
Each race bees times build slightly differently depending flora original region blooms
Some regions Europe two nectar flows one late spring another late August
Other regions single nectar flow
The skill beekeeper lies predicting nectar flow occur area trying ensure colonies achieve maximum population harvesters exactly right time
The key factor prevention skillful management swarming impulse
If colony swarms unexpectedly beekeeper manage capture resulting swarm likely harvest significantly less honey hive since lost half worker bees single stroke
If however use swarming impulse breed new queen keep bees colony together maximizes chances good harvest
It takes many years learning experience able manage aspects successfully though owing variable circumstances many beginners often achieve good honey harvest
Formation new colonies Colony reproduction swarming supersedure All colonies totally dependent queen egg layer
However even best queens live years one two years longevity norm
She choose whether fertilize egg lays develops female worker bee lays unfertilized egg becomes male drone
She decides type egg lay depending size open brood cell encounters comb
In small worker cell lays fertilized egg finds larger drone cell lays unfertilized drone egg
All time queen fertile laying eggs produces variety pheromones control behavior bees hive
These commonly called queen substance various pheromones different functions
As queen ages begins run stored sperm pheromones begin fail
Inevitably queen begins falter bees decide replace creating new queen one worker eggs
They may damaged lost leg antenna run sperm cannot lay fertilized eggs become drone laying queen pheromones dwindled cannot control bees hive
At juncture bees produce one queen cells modifying existing worker cells contain normal female egg
They pursue one two ways replace queen supersedure replacing superseding queen without swarming swarm cell production dividing hive two colonies swarming
Supersedure highly valued behavioral trait beekeepers
A hive supersedes old queen lose stock
Instead creates new queen old one fades away killed new queen emerges
In hives bees produce one two queen cells characteristically center face broodcomb
Swarm cell production involves creating many queen cells typically dozen
These located around edges broodcomb often sides bottom
Once either process begun old queen leaves hive hatching first queen cells
She leaves accompanied large number bees predominantly young bees wax secretors form basis new hive
Scouts sent swarm find suitable hollow trees rock crevices
As soon one found entire swarm moves
Within matter hours build new wax brood combs using honey stores young bees filled leaving old hive
Only young bees secrete wax special abdominal segments swarms tend contain young bees
Often number virgin queens accompany first swarm prime swarm old queen replaced soon daughter queen mates begins laying
Otherwise quickly superseded new home
Different sub species Apis mellifera exhibit differing swarming characteristics
In general northerly black races said swarm less supersede whereas southerly yellow grey varieties said swarm frequently
The truth complicated prevalence cross breeding hybridization sub species
Factors trigger swarming Some beekeepers may monitor colonies carefully spring watch appearance queen cells dramatic signal colony determined swarm
This swarm looks shelter
A beekeeper may capture introduce new hive helping meet need
Otherwise returns feral state case finds shelter hollow tree excavation abandoned chimney even behind shutters
A small swarm less chance survival may threaten original hive survival number individuals left unsustainable
When hive swarms despite beekeeper preventative efforts good management practice give reduced hive couple frames open brood eggs
This helps replenish hive quickly gives second opportunity raise queen mating failure
Each race sub species honey bee swarming characteristics
Italian bees prolific inclined swarm Northern European black bees strong tendency supersede old queen without swarming
These differences result differing evolutionary pressures regions sub species evolved
Artificial swarming When colony accidentally loses queen said queenless
The workers realize queen absent little hour pheromones fade hive
Instinctively workers select cells containing eggs aged less three days enlarge cells dramatically form emergency queen cells
These appear similar large peanut like structures inch long hang center side brood combs
The developing larva queen cell fed differently ordinary worker bee addition normal honey pollen receives great deal royal jelly special food secreted young nurse bees hypopharyngeal gland
This special food dramatically alters growth development larva metamorphosis pupation emerges cell queen bee
The queen bee colony fully developed ovaries secretes pheromone suppresses normal development ovaries workers
Beekeepers use ability bees produce new queens increase colonies procedure called splitting colony
To remove several brood combs healthy hive taking care leave old queen behind
These combs must contain eggs larvae less three days old covered young nurse bees care brood keep warm
These brood combs attendant nurse bees placed small nucleus hive combs containing honey pollen
As soon nurse bees find new hive realize queen set constructing emergency queen cells using eggs larvae combs
Losses Diseases The common agents disease affect adult honey bees include fungi bacteria protozoa viruses parasites poisons
The gross symptoms displayed affected adult bees similar whatever cause making difficult apiarist ascertain causes problems without microscopic identification microorganisms chemical analysis poisons
Since colony losses colony collapse disorder increasing across world although causes syndrome yet unknown
In US commercial beekeepers increasing number hives deal higher rates attrition
Parasites Galleria mellonella Achroia grisella wax moth larvae hatch tunnel destroy comb contains bee larvae honey stores
The tunnels create lined silk entangles starves emerging bees
Destruction honeycombs also results honey leaking wasted
A healthy hive manage wax moths weak colonies unoccupied hives stored frames decimated Small hive beetle Aethina tumida native Africa spread continents
It serious pest among honey bees unadapted Varroa destructor Varroa mite established pest two species honey bee many parts world blamed many researchers leading cause CCD Acarapis woodi tracheal mite infests trachea honey bees
Predators Most predators prefer eat honeybees due unpleasant sting still predators
These include large animals skunks bears honey brood nest well adult bees
Some birds also eat bees example bee eaters named bee centric diet robber flies Mallophora ruficauda pest apiculture South America due habit eating workers foraging meadows
World apiculture According U N FAO data world beehive stock rose around million around million comes average annual growth
Average annual growth accelerated since
