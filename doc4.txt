Machine translation sometimes referred abbreviation MT confused computer aided translation machine aided human translation MAHT interactive translation sub field computational linguistics investigates use software translate text speech one language another
On basic level MT performs simple substitution words one language words another alone usually cannot produce good translation text recognition whole phrases closest counterparts target language needed
Solving problem corpus statistical neural techniques rapidly growing field leading better translations handling differences linguistic typology translation idioms isolation anomalies Current machine translation software often allows customization domain profession weather reports improving output limiting scope allowable substitutions
This technique particularly effective domains formal formulaic language used
It follows machine translation government legal documents readily produces usable output conversation less standardised text
Improved output quality also achieved human intervention example systems able translate accurately user unambiguously identified words text proper names
With assistance techniques MT proven useful tool assist human translators limited number cases even produce output used e g weather reports
The progress potential machine translation debated much history
Since number scholars questioned possibility achieving fully automatic machine translation high quality first notably Yehoshua Bar Hillel
Some critics claim principle obstacles automating translation process
History The origins machine translation traced back work Al Kindi th century Arabic cryptographer developed techniques systemic language translation including cryptanalysis frequency analysis probability statistics used modern machine translation
The idea machine translation later appeared th century
In Ren√© Descartes proposed universal language equivalent ideas different tongues sharing one symbol The field machine translation founded Warren Weaver Memorandum Translation
The first researcher field Yehosha Bar Hillel began research MIT
A Georgetown University MT research team followed public demonstration Georgetown IBM experiment system
MT research programs popped Japan Russia first MT conference held London
Researchers continued join field Association Machine Translation Computational Linguistics formed U S National Academy Sciences formed Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee ALPAC study MT
Real progress much slower however ALPAC report found ten year long research failed fulfill expectations funding greatly reduced
According report Director Defense Research Engineering DDR E feasibility large scale MT reestablished success Logos MT system translating military manuals Vietnamese conflict
The French Textile Institute also used MT translate abstracts French English German Spanish Brigham Young University started project translate Mormon texts automated translation Xerox used SYSTRAN translate technical manuals
Beginning late computational power increased became less expensive interest shown statistical models machine translation
MT became popular advent computers
SYSTRAN first implementation system implemented online service French Postal Service called Minitel
Various MT companies also launched including Trados first develop market translation memory technology
The first commercial MT system Russian English German Ukrainian developed Kharkov State University
MT web started SYSTRAN offering free translation small texts followed AltaVista Babelfish racked requests day
Franz Josef Och future head Translation Development AT Google DARPA speed MT competition
More innovations time included MOSES open source statistical MT engine text SMS translation service mobiles Japan mobile phone built speech speech translation functionality English Japanese Chinese
Recently Google announced Google Translate translates roughly enough text fill million books one day
The idea using digital computers translation natural languages proposed early A D Booth possibly others
Warren Weaver wrote important memorandum Translation
The Georgetown experiment means first application demonstration made APEXC machine Birkbeck College University London rudimentary translation English French
Several papers topic published time even articles popular journals example article Cleave Zacharov September issue Wireless World
A similar application also pioneered Birkbeck College time reading composing Braille texts computer
Translation process The human translation process may described Decoding meaning source text Re encoding meaning target language Behind ostensibly simple procedure lies complex cognitive operation
To decode meaning source text entirety translator must interpret analyse features text process requires depth knowledge grammar semantics syntax idioms etc source language well culture speakers
The translator needs depth knowledge encode meaning target language
Therein lies challenge machine translation program computer understand text person create new text target language sounds written person
In general application beyond current technology
Though works much faster automated translation program procedure human participation produce output even close quality human translator produce
What however provide general though imperfect approximation original text getting gist process called gisting
This sufficient many purposes including making best use finite expensive time human translator reserved cases total accuracy indispensable
This problem may approached number ways evolution accuracy improved
Approaches Machine translation use method based linguistic rules means words translated linguistic way suitable orally speaking words target language replace ones source language It often argued success machine translation requires problem natural language understanding solved first Generally rule based methods parse text usually creating intermediary symbolic representation text target language generated
According nature intermediary representation approach described interlingual machine translation transfer based machine translation
These methods require extensive lexicons morphological syntactic semantic information large sets rules
Given enough data machine translation programs often work well enough native speaker one language get approximate meaning written native speaker
The difficulty getting enough data right kind support particular method
For example large multilingual corpus data needed statistical methods work necessary grammar based methods
But grammar methods need skilled linguist carefully design grammar use
To translate closely related languages technique referred rule based machine translation may used
Rule based The rule based machine translation paradigm includes transfer based machine translation interlingual machine translation dictionary based machine translation paradigms
This type translation used mostly creation dictionaries grammar programs
Unlike methods RBMT involves information linguistics source target languages using morphological syntactic rules semantic analysis languages
The basic approach involves linking structure input sentence structure output sentence using parser analyzer source language generator target language transfer lexicon actual translation
RBMT biggest downfall everything must made explicit orthographical variation erroneous input must made part source language analyser order cope lexical selection rules must written instances ambiguity
Adapting new domains hard core grammar across domains domain specific adjustment limited lexical selection adjustment
Transfer based machine translation Transfer based machine translation similar interlingual machine translation creates translation intermediate representation simulates meaning original sentence
Unlike interlingual MT depends partially language pair involved translation
Interlingual Interlingual machine translation one instance rule based machine translation approaches
In approach source language e
text translated transformed interlingual language e
language neutral representation independent language
The target language generated interlingua
One major advantages system interlingua becomes valuable number target languages turned increases
However interlingual machine translation system made operational commercial level KANT system Nyberg Mitamura designed translate Caterpillar Technical English CTE languages
Dictionary based Machine translation use method based dictionary entries means words translated dictionary
Statistical Statistical machine translation tries generate translations using statistical methods based bilingual text corpora Canadian Hansard corpus English French record Canadian parliament EUROPARL record European Parliament
Where corpora available good results achieved translating similar texts corpora still rare many language pairs
The first statistical machine translation software CANDIDE IBM
Google used SYSTRAN several years switched statistical translation method October
In Google improved internal translation capabilities using approximately billion words United Nations materials train system translation accuracy improved
Google Translate similar statistical translation programs work detecting patterns hundreds millions documents previously translated humans making intelligent guesses based findings
Generally human translated documents available given language likely translation good quality
Newer approaches Statistical Machine translation METIS II PRESEMT use minimal corpus size instead focus derivation syntactic structure pattern recognition
With development may allow statistical machine translation operate monolingual text corpus
SMT biggest downfall includes dependent upon huge amounts parallel texts problems morphology rich languages especially translating languages inability correct singleton errors
Example based Example based machine translation EBMT approach proposed Makoto Nagao
Example based machine translation based idea analogy
In approach corpus used one contains texts already translated
Given sentence translated sentences corpus selected contain similar sub sentential components
The similar sentences used translate sub sentential components original sentence target language phrases put together form complete translation
Hybrid MT Hybrid machine translation HMT leverages strengths statistical rule based translation methodologies
Several MT organizations claim hybrid approach uses rules statistics
The approaches differ number ways Rules post processed statistics Translations performed using rules based engine
Statistics used attempt adjust correct output rules engine
Statistics guided rules Rules used pre process data attempt better guide statistical engine
Rules also used post process statistical output perform functions normalization
This approach lot power flexibility control translating
It also provides extensive control way content processed pre translation e g
markup content non translatable terms post translation e g
post translation corrections adjustments More recently advent Neural MT new version hybrid machine translation emerging combines benefits rules statistical neural machine translation
The approach allows benefitting pre post processing rule guided workflow well benefitting NMT SMT
The downside inherent complexity makes approach suitable specific use cases
One proponents approach complex use cases Omniscien Technologies
Neural MT A deep learning based approach MT neural machine translation made rapid progress recent years Google announced translation services using technology preference previous statistical methods
Microsoft team reached human parity WMT historical milestone
Major issues Disambiguation Word sense disambiguation concerns finding suitable translation word one meaning
The problem first raised Yehoshua Bar Hillel
He pointed without universal encyclopedia machine would never able distinguish two meanings word
Today numerous approaches designed overcome problem
They approximately divided shallow approaches deep approaches
Shallow approaches assume knowledge text
They simply apply statistical methods words surrounding ambiguous word
Deep approaches presume comprehensive knowledge word
So far shallow approaches successful Claude Piron long time translator United Nations World Health Organization wrote machine translation best automates easier part translator job harder time consuming part usually involves extensive research resolve ambiguities source text grammatical lexical exigencies target language require resolved Why translator need whole workday translate five pages hour two
About average text corresponds simple conditions
But unfortunately
It part requires six hours work
There ambiguities one resolve
For instance author source text Australian physician cited example epidemic declared World War II Japanese prisoner war camp
Was talking American camp Japanese prisoners Japanese camp American prisoners
The English two senses
It necessary therefore research maybe extent phone call Australia The ideal deep approach would require translation software research necessary kind disambiguation would require higher degree AI yet attained
A shallow approach simply guessed sense ambiguous English phrase Piron mentions based perhaps kind prisoner war camp often mentioned given corpus would reasonable chance guessing wrong fairly often
A shallow approach involves ask user ambiguity would Piron estimate automate professional translator job leaving harder still done human
Non standard speech One major pitfalls MT inability translate non standard language accuracy standard language
Heuristic statistical based MT takes input various sources standard form language
Rule based translation nature include common non standard usages
This causes errors translation vernacular source colloquial language
Limitations translation casual speech present issues use machine translation mobile devices
Named entities Related named entity recognition information extraction Name entities narrow sense refer concrete abstract entities real world including people organizations companies places etc
It also refers expressing time space quantity July Named entities occur text analyzed statistical machine translation
The initial difficulty arises dealing named entities simply identifying text
Consider list names common particular language illustrate common names different language also constantly changing
If named entities cannot recognized machine translator may erroneously translated common nouns would likely affect BLEU rating translation would change text human readability
It also possible identified named entities omitted output translation would also implications text readability message
Another way deal named entities use transliteration instead translation meaning find letters target language closely correspond name source language
There attempts incorporate machine translation adding transliteration step translation procedure
However attempts still problems even cited worsening quality translation
Named entities still identified incorrectly words transliterated transliterated
For example Southern California first word translated directly second word transliterated
However machines would often transliterate treated one entity
Words like hard machine translators even transliteration component process
The lack attention issue named entity translation recognized potentially stemming lack resources devote task addition complexity creating good system named entity translation
One approach named entity translation transliterate translate words
A second create translate list end goal transliteration opposed translation
Both approaches still rely correct identification named entities however
A third approach successful named entity translation class based model
In method named entities replaced token represent class belong
For example Ted Erica would replaced person class token
In way statistical distribution use person names general analyzed instead looking distributions Ted Erica individually
A problem class based model solves probability given name specific language affect assigned probability translation
A study Stanford improving area translation gives examples different probabilities assigned David going walk Ankit going walk English target language due different number occurrences name training data
A frustrating outcome study Stanford attempts improve named recognition translation many times decrease BLEU scores translation result inclusion methods named entity translation
Translation multiparallel sources Some work done utilization multiparallel corpora body text translated languages
Using methods text translated languages may utilized combination provide accurate translation third language compared one source languages used alone
Ontologies MT An ontology formal representation knowledge includes concepts objects processes etc
domain relations
If stored information linguistic nature one speak lexicon
In NLP ontologies used source knowledge machine translation systems
With access large knowledge base systems enabled resolve many especially lexical ambiguities
In following classic examples humans able interpret prepositional phrase according context use world knowledge stored lexicons I saw man star molecule microscope telescope binoculars
A machine translation system initially would able differentiate meanings syntax change
With large enough ontology source knowledge however possible interpretations ambiguous words specific context reduced
Other areas usage ontologies within NLP include information retrieval information extraction text summarization
Building ontologies The ontology generated PANGLOSS knowledge based machine translation system may serve example ontology NLP purposes compiled A large scale ontology necessary help parsing active modules machine translation system
In PANGLOSS example nodes intended subsumed smaller manually built upper abstract region ontology
Because size created automatically
The goal merge two resources LDOCE online WordNet combine benefits concise definitions Longman semantic relations allowing semi automatic taxonomization ontology WordNet
A definition match algorithm created automatically merge correct meanings ambiguous words two online resources based words definitions meanings common LDOCE WordNet
Using similarity matrix algorithm delivered matches meanings including confidence factor
This algorithm alone however match meanings correctly
A second hierarchy match algorithm therefore created uses taxonomic hierarchies found WordNet deep hierarchies partially LDOCE flat hierarchies
This works first matching unambiguous meanings limiting search space respective ancestors descendants matched meanings
Thus algorithm matched locally unambiguous meanings instance word seal ambiguous one meaning seal animal subhierarchy
Both algorithms complemented helped constructing large scale ontology machine translation system
The WordNet hierarchies coupled matching definitions LDOCE subordinated ontology upper region
As result PANGLOSS MT system able make use knowledge base mainly generation element
Applications While system provides holy grail fully automatic high quality machine translation unrestricted text many fully automated systems produce reasonable output
The quality machine translation substantially improved domain restricted controlled Despite inherent limitations MT programs used around world
Probably largest institutional user European Commission
The MOLTO project example coordinated University Gothenburg received million euros project support EU create reliable translation tool covers majority EU languages
The development MT systems comes time budget cuts human translation may increase EU dependency reliable MT programs
The European Commission contributed million euros via ISA programme creation MT EC statistical machine translation program tailored administrative needs EU replace previous rule based machine translation system In Google claimed promising results obtained using proprietary statistical machine translation engine
The statistical translation engine used Google language tools Arabic English Chinese English overall score runner IBM BLEU score Summer tests conducted National Institute Standards Technology With recent focus terrorism military sources United States investing significant amounts money natural language engineering
In Q Tel venture capital fund largely funded US Intelligence Community stimulate new technologies private sector entrepreneurs brought companies like Language Weaver
Currently military community interested translation processing languages like Arabic Pashto Dari
Within languages focus key phrases quick communication military members civilians use mobile phone apps
The Information Processing Technology Office DARPA hosts programs like TIDES Babylon translator
US Air Force awarded million contract develop language translation technology The notable rise social networking web recent years created yet another niche application machine translation software utilities Facebook instant messaging clients Skype GoogleTalk MSN Messenger etc
allowing users speaking different languages communicate
Machine translation applications also released mobile devices including mobile telephones pocket PCs PDAs etc
Due portability instruments come designated mobile translation tools enabling mobile business networking partners speaking different languages facilitating foreign language learning unaccompanied traveling foreign countries without need intermediation human translator
Despite labelled unworthy competitor human translation Automated Language Processing Advisory Committee put together United States government quality machine translation improved levels application online collaboration medical field investigated
The application technology medical settings human translators absent another topic research difficulties arise due importance accurate translations medical diagnoses
Evaluation There many factors affect machine translation systems evaluated
These factors include intended use translation nature machine translation software nature translation process
Different programs may work well different purposes
For example statistical machine translation SMT typically outperforms example based machine translation EBMT researchers found evaluating English French translation EBMT performs better
The concept applies technical documents easily translated SMT formal language
In certain applications however e g product descriptions written controlled language dictionary based machine translation system produced satisfactory translations require human intervention save quality inspection There various means evaluating output quality machine translation systems
The oldest use human judges assess translation quality
Even though human evaluation time consuming still reliable method compare different systems rule based statistical systems
Automated means evaluation include BLEU NIST METEOR LEPOR Relying exclusively unedited machine translation ignores fact communication human language context embedded takes person comprehend context original text reasonable degree probability
It certainly true even purely human generated translations prone error
Therefore ensure machine generated translation useful human publishable quality translation achieved translations must reviewed edited human
The late Claude Piron wrote machine translation best automates easier part translator job harder time consuming part usually involves extensive research resolve ambiguities source text grammatical lexical exigencies target language require resolved
Such research necessary prelude pre editing necessary order provide input machine translation software output meaningless In addition disambiguation problems decreased accuracy occur due varying levels training data machine translating programs
Both example based statistical machine translation rely vast array real example sentences base translation many sentences analyzed accuracy jeopardized
Researchers found program trained sentence pairings accuracy actually decreases
The optimal level training data seems sentences possibly training data increases number possible sentences increases making harder find exact translation match
Using machine translation teaching tool Although concerns machine translation accuracy Dr Ana Nino University Manchester researched advantages utilizing machine translation classroom
One pedagogical method called using MT Bad Model
MT Bad Model forces language learner identify inconsistencies incorrect aspects translation turn individual hopefully possess better grasp language
Dr Nino cites teaching tool implemented late
At end various semesters Dr Nino able obtain survey results students used MT Bad Model well models
Overwhelmingly students felt observed improved comprehension lexical retrieval increased confidence target language
Machine translation signed languages In early options machine translation spoken signed languages severely limited
It common belief deaf individuals could use traditional translators
However stress intonation pitch timing conveyed much differently spoken languages compared signed languages
Therefore deaf individual may misinterpret become confused meaning written text based spoken language Researchers Zhao et al
developed prototype called TEAM translation English ASL machine completed English American Sign Language ASL translations
The program would first analyze syntactic grammatical morphological aspects English text
Following step program accessed sign synthesizer acted dictionary ASL
This synthesizer housed process one must follow complete ASL signs well meanings signs
Once entire text analyzed signs necessary complete translation located synthesizer computer generated human appeared would use ASL sign English text user
