The implementation neuromorphic computing hardware level realized oxide based memristors spintronic memories threshold switches transistors A key aspect neuromorphic engineering understanding morphology individual neurons circuits applications overall architectures creates desirable computations affects information represented influences robustness damage incorporates learning development adapts local change plasticity facilitates evolutionary change
Neuromorphic engineering interdisciplinary subject takes inspiration biology physics mathematics computer science electronic engineering design artificial neural systems vision systems head eye systems auditory processors autonomous robots whose physical architecture design principles based biological nervous systems
Examples As early researchers Georgia Tech published field programmable neural array
This chip first line increasingly complex arrays floating gate transistors allowed programmability charge gates MOSFETs model channel ion characteristics neurons brain one first cases silicon programmable array neurons
In November group MIT researchers created computer chip mimics analog ion based communication synapse two neurons using transistors standard CMOS manufacturing techniques In June spintronic researchers Purdue presented paper design neuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves memristors
They argue architecture works similarly neurons therefore used test methods reproducing brain processing
In addition chips significantly energy efficient conventional ones Research HP Labs Mott memristors shown non volatile volatile behavior exhibited temperatures significantly phase transition temperature exploited fabricate neuristor biologically inspired device mimics behavior found neurons

Ethical considerations While interdisciplinary concept neuromorphic engineering relatively new many ethical considerations apply neuromorphic systems apply human like machines artificial intelligence general
However fact neuromorphic systems designed mimic human brain gives rise unique ethical questions surrounding usage
However practical debate neuromorphic hardware well artificial neural networks immensely simplified models brain operates processes information much lower complexity terms size functional technology much regular structure terms connectivity
Comparing neuromorphic chips brain crude comparison similar comparing plane bird wings tail
The fact neural cognitive systems many orders magnitude energy compute efficient current state art AI neuromorphic engineering attempt narrow gap inspiring brain mechanism like many engineering designs bio inspired features
Democratic concerns Significant ethical limitations may placed neuromorphic engineering due public perception
Special Eurobarometer Public Attitudes Towards Robots survey conducted European Commission found European Union citizens wanted ban robots care children elderly disabled
Furthermore favor ban robots education healthcare leisure
The European Commission classifies areas notably human The report cites increased public concern robots able mimic replicate human functions
Neuromorphic engineering definition designed replicate human function function human brain The democratic concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering likely become even profound future
The European Commission found EU citizens ages likely think robots human like opposed instrument like EU citizens age
When presented image robot defined human like EU citizens aged said corresponded idea robots EU citizens age responded way
The human like nature neuromorphic systems therefore could place categories robots many EU citizens would like see banned future
Personhood As neuromorphic systems become increasingly advanced scholars advocated granting personhood rights systems
If brain grants humans personhood extent neuromorphic system mimic human brain granted personhood rights
Critics technology development Human Brain Project aims advance brain inspired computing argued advancement neuromorphic computing could lead machine consciousness personhood
If systems treated people critics argue many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems including act termination neuromorphic systems may morally impermissible acts would violate autonomy neuromorphic systems However skeptics position argued way apply electronic personhood concept personhood would apply neuromorphic technology legally
In letter signed experts law robotics medicine ethics opposing European Commission proposal recognize smart robots legal persons authors write A legal status robot derive Natural Person model since robot would hold human rights right dignity right integrity right remuneration right citizenship thus directly confronting Human rights
This would contradiction Charter Fundamental Rights European Union Convention Protection Human Rights Fundamental Freedoms Ownership property rights There significant legal debate around property rights artificial intelligence
In Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd Justice Christopher Jessup Federal Court Australia found source code Material Safety Data Sheets could copyrighted generated software interface rather human author
The question may apply neuromorphic systems neuromorphic system successfully mimics human brain produces piece original work anyone able claim ownership work
Neuromemristive systems Neuromemristive systems subclass neuromorphic computing systems focus use memristors implement neuroplasticity
While neuromorphic engineering focuses mimicking biological behavior neuromemristive systems focus abstraction
For example neuromemristive system may replace details cortical microcircuit behavior abstract neural network model There exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions implemented memristors applications high level pattern recognition applications
Some applications reported recently include speech recognition face recognition object recognition
They also find applications replacing conventional digital logic gates For ideal passive memristive circuits possible derive system differential equations evolution Caravelli Traversa Di Ventra equation internal memory circuit W α W β I ξ Ω W Ω S displaystyle frac dt vec W alpha vec W frac beta I xi Omega W Omega vec S function properties physical memristive network external sources
In equation α displaystyle alpha forgetting time scale constant ξ r displaystyle xi r r R R displaystyle r frac R_ text R_ text ratio values limit resistances memristors S displaystyle vec S vector sources circuit Ω displaystyle Omega projector fundamental loops circuit
The constant β displaystyle beta dimension voltage associated properties memristor physical origin charge mobility conductor
The diagonal matrix vector W diag W displaystyle W operatorname diag vec W W displaystyle vec W respectively instead internal value memristors values
This equation thus requires adding extra constraints memory values order reliable

A frame language technology used knowledge representation artificial intelligence
Frames stored ontologies sets subsets frame concepts
They similar class hierarchies object oriented languages although fundamental design goals different
Frames focused explicit intuitive representation knowledge whereas objects focus encapsulation information hiding
Frames originated AI research objects primarily software engineering
However practice techniques capabilities frame object oriented languages overlap significantly
Description Early work Frames inspired psychological research going back indicated people use stored stereotypical knowledge interpret act new cognitive situations
The term Frame first used Marvin Minsky paradigm understand visual reasoning natural language processing
In many types problems potential solution space even smallest problem huge
For example extracting phonemes raw audio stream detecting edges object
Things seem trivial humans actually quite complex
In fact difficult really probably fully understood AI researchers began investigate complexity getting computers solve
The initial notion Frames Scripts also called would establish context problem automatically reduce possible search space significantly
The idea also adopted Schank Abelson used illustrate AI system could process common human interactions ordering meal restaurant
These interactions standardized Frames slots stored relevant information Frame
Slots analogous object properties object oriented modeling relations entity relation models
Slots often default values also required refinement part execution instance scenario
I e execution task ordering restaurant controlled starting basic instance Frame instantiating refining various values appropriate
Essentially abstract Frame represented object class frame instances object instance
In early work emphasis primarily static data descriptions Frame
Various mechanisms developed define range slot default values etc
However even early systems procedural capabilities
One common technique use triggers similar database concept triggers attached slots
A trigger simply procedural code attached slot
The trigger could fire either slot value accessed modified
As object classes Frames organized subsumption hierarchies
For example basic frame might ordering restaurant
An instance would Joe goes McDonald
A specialization essentially subclass restaurant frame would frame ordering fancy restaurant
The fancy restaurant frame would inherit default values restaurant frame also would either add slots change one default values e g expected price range specialized frame Much early Frame language research e g
Schank Abelson driven findings experimental psychology attempts design knowledge representation tools corresponded patterns humans thought use function daily tasks
These researchers less interested mathematical formality since believed formalisms necessarily good models way average human conceptualizes world
The way humans use language example often far truly logical
Similarly linguistics Charles J Fillmore mid started working theory frame semantics later would lead computational resources like FrameNet
Frame semantics motivated reflections human language human cognition
Researchers Ron Brachman hand wanted give AI researchers mathematical formalism computational power associated Logic
Their aim map Frame classes slots constraints rules Frame language set theory logic
One benefits approach validation even creation models could automated using theorem provers automated reasoning capabilities
The drawback could difficult initially specify model language formal semantics
This evolution also illustrates classic divide AI research known neats vs scruffies
The neats researchers placed value mathematical precision formalism could achieved via First Order Logic Set Theory
The scruffies interested modeling knowledge representations intuitive psychologically meaningful humans The notable formal approaches KL ONE language
KL ONE later went spawn several subsequent Frame languages
The formal semantics languages KL ONE gave frame languages new type automated reasoning capability known classifier
The classifier engine analyzes various declarations frame language definition sets subsets relations etc
The classifier automatically deduce various additional relations detect parts model inconsistent
In way many tasks would normally executed forward backward chaining inference engine instead performed classifier This technology especially valuable dealing Internet
It interesting result formalism languages KL ONE useful dealing highly informal unstructured data found Internet
On Internet simply feasible require systems standardize one data model
It inevitable terminology used multiple inconsistent forms
The automatic classification capability classifier engine provides AI developers powerful toolbox help bring order consistency inconsistent collection data e Internet
The vision enhanced Internet pages ordered text keywords classification concepts known Semantic Web
Classification technology originally developed Frame languages key enabler Semantic Web
The neats vs scruffies divide also emerged Semantic Web research culminating creation Linking Open Data community focus exposing data Web rather modeling
Example A simple example concepts modeled frame language Friend A Friend FOAF ontology defined part Semantic Web foundation social networking calendar systems
The primary frame simple example Person
Example slots person email home page phone etc
The interests person represented additional frames describing space business entertainment domains
The slot knows links person persons
Default values person interests inferred web people friends
Implementations The earliest Frame based languages custom developed specific research projects packaged tools used researchers
Just expert system inference engines researchers soon realized benefits extracting part core infrastructure developing general purpose frame languages coupled specific applications
One first general purpose frame languages KRL
One influential early Frame languages KL ONE KL ONE spawned several subsequent Frame languages
One widely used successors KL ONE Loom language developed Robert MacGregor Information Sciences Institute In Artificial Intelligence generated great deal interest business world fueled expert systems
This led development many commercial products development knowledge based systems
These early products usually developed Lisp integrated constructs IF THEN rules logical reasoning Frame hierarchies representing data
One well known early Lisp knowledge base tools Knowledge Engineering Environment KEE Intellicorp
KEE provided full Frame language multiple inheritance slots triggers default values rule engine supported backward forward chaining
As early commercial versions AI software KEE originally deployed Lisp Lisp machine platforms eventually ported PCs Unix workstations The research agenda Semantic Web spawned renewed interest automatic classification frame languages
An example Web Ontology Language OWL standard describing information Internet
OWL standard provide semantic layer top Internet
The goal rather organizing web using keywords applications e g
Google today web organized concepts organized ontology
The name OWL language provides good example value Semantic Web
If one search OWL using Internet today pages retrieved would bird Owl rather standard OWL
With Semantic Web would possible specify concept Web Ontology Language user would need worry various possible acronyms synonyms part search
Likewise user would need worry homonyms crowding search results irrelevant data information birds prey simple example
In addition OWL various standards technologies relevant Semantic Web influenced Frame languages include OIL DAML
The Protege Open Source software tool Stanford University provides ontology editing capability built OWL full capabilities classifier
However ceased explicitly support frames version maintained preferring frame orientation version current
The justification moving explicit frames OWL DL expressive industry standard
Comparison frames objects Frame languages significant overlap object oriented languages
The terminologies goals two communities different moved academic world labs commercial world developers tended care philosophical issues focused primarily specific capabilities taking best either camp regardless idea began
What paradigms common desire reduce distance concepts real world implementation software
As paradigms arrived idea representing primary software objects taxonomies starting general types progressing specific types
The following table illustrates correlation standard terminology object oriented frame language communities The primary difference two paradigms degree encapsulation considered major requirement
For object oriented paradigm encapsulation one critical requirement
The desire reduce potential interactions software components hence manage large complex systems key driver object oriented technology
For frame language camp requirement less critical desire provide vast array possible tools represent rules constraints programming logic
In object oriented world everything controlled methods visibility methods
So example accessing data value object property must done via accessor method
This method controls things validating data type constraints value retrieved set property
In Frame languages types constraints could handled multiple ways
Triggers could defined fire value set retrieved
Rules could defined managed types constraints
The slots could augmented additional information called facets languages type constraint information
The main differentiator frame OO languages multiple inheritance allowing frame class two superclasses
For frame languages multiple inheritance requirement
This follows desire model world way humans human conceptualizations world seldom fall rigidly defined non overlapping taxonomies
For many OO languages especially later years OO single inheritance either strongly desired required
Multiple inheritance seen possible step analysis phase model domain something eliminated design implementation phases name maintaining encapsulation modularity Although early frame languages KRL include message passing driven demands developers later frame languages e g
Loom KEE included ability define messages Frames On object oriented side standards also emerged provide essentially equivalent functionality frame languages provided albeit different format standardized object libraries
For example Object Management Group standardized specifications capabilities associating test data constraints objects analogous common uses facets Frames constraints Frame languages Loom integrating rule engines

The mind body problem debate concerning relationship thought consciousness human mind brain part physical body
It distinct question mind body function chemically physiologically question presupposes interactionist account mind body relations
This question arises mind body considered distinct based premise mind body fundamentally different nature The problem addressed René Descartes th century resulting Cartesian dualism pre Aristotelian philosophers Avicennian philosophy earlier Asian traditions
A variety approaches proposed
Most either dualist monist
Dualism maintains rigid distinction realms mind matter
Monism maintains one unifying reality substance essence terms everything explained
Each categories contains numerous variants
The two main forms dualism substance dualism holds mind formed distinct type substance governed laws physics property dualism holds mental properties involving conscious experience fundamental properties alongside fundamental properties identified completed physics
The three main forms monism physicalism holds mind consists matter organized particular way idealism holds thought truly exists matter merely illusion neutral monism holds mind matter aspects distinct essence identical neither
Psychophysical parallelism third possible alternative regarding relation mind body interaction dualism one sided action monism Several philosophical perspectives developed reject mind body dichotomy
The historical materialism Karl Marx subsequent writers form physicalism held consciousness engendered material contingencies one environment
An explicit rejection dichotomy found French structuralism position generally characterized post war Continental philosophy The absence empirically identifiable meeting point non physical mind thing physical extension thing proven problematic dualism many modern philosophers mind maintain mind something separate body
These approaches particularly influential sciences particularly fields sociobiology computer science evolutionary psychology neurosciences An ancient model mind known Five Aggregate Model described Buddhist teachings explains mind continuously changing sense impressions mental phenomena
Considering model possible understand constantly changing sense impressions mental phenomena e mind experiences analyzes external phenomena world well internal phenomena including body anatomy nervous system well organ brain
This conceptualization leads two levels analyses analyses conducted third person perspective brain works ii analyzing moment moment manifestation individual mind stream analyses conducted first person perspective
Considering latter manifestation mind stream described happening every person time even scientist analyses various phenomena world including analyzing hypothesizing organ brain
Mind body interaction mental causation Philosophers David L Robb John F Heil introduce mental causation terms mind body problem interaction Mind body interaction central place pretheoretic conception agency
Indeed mental causation often figures explicitly formulations mind body problem
Some philosophers insist notion psychological explanation turns intelligibility mental causation
If mind states beliefs desires causally isolated bodily behavior goes mind could explain
If psychological explanation goes closely related notions agency moral responsibility
Clearly good deal rides satisfactory solution problem mental causation one way puzzles mind causal relevance behavior physical world generally arise
René Descartes set agenda subsequent discussions mind body relation
According Descartes minds bodies distinct kinds substance
Bodies held spatially extended substances incapable feeling thought minds contrast unextended thinking feeling substances
If minds bodies radically different kinds substance however easy see could causally interact
Princess Elizabeth Bohemia puts forcefully letter human soul determine movement animal spirits body perform voluntary acts merely conscious substance
For determination movement seems always come moving body propelled depend kind impulse gets sets motion nature shape latter thing surface
Now first two conditions involve contact third involves impelling thing extension utterly exclude extension notion soul contact seems incompatible thing immaterial Elizabeth expressing prevailing mechanistic view causation bodies works
Causal relations countenanced contemporary physics take several forms push pull variety
Contemporary neurophilosopher Georg Northoff suggests mental causation compatible classical formal final causality Biologist theoretical neuroscientist philosopher Walter J Freeman suggests explaining mind body interaction terms circular causation relevant linear causation In neuroscience much learned correlations brain activity subjective conscious experiences
Many suggest neuroscience ultimately explain consciousness consciousness biological process eventually explained terms molecular signaling pathways used interacting populations nerve cells However view criticized consciousness yet shown process hard problem relating consciousness directly brain activity remains elusive
Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested embodiment human perception thinking action
Abstract information processing models longer accepted satisfactory accounts human mind
Interest shifted interactions material human body surroundings way interactions shape mind
Proponents approach expressed hope ultimately dissolve Cartesian divide immaterial mind material existence human beings Damasio Gallagher
A topic seems particularly promising providing bridge across mind body cleavage study bodily actions neither reflexive reactions external stimuli indications mental states arbitrary relationships motor features action e g pressing button making choice response
The shape timing effects actions inseparable meaning
One might say loaded mental content cannot appreciated studying material features
Imitation communicative gesturing tool use examples kinds actions
Neural correlates The neural correlates consciousness smallest set brain mechanisms events sufficient specific conscious feeling elemental color red complex sensual mysterious primeval sensation evoked looking jungle scene Neuroscientists use empirical approaches discover neural correlates subjective phenomena
Neurobiology neurophilosophy A science consciousness must explain exact relationship subjective conscious mental states brain states formed electrochemical interactions body called hard problem consciousness Neurobiology studies connection scientifically neuropsychology neuropsychiatry
Neurophilosophy interdisciplinary study neuroscience philosophy mind
In pursuit neurophilosophers Patricia Churchland Paul Churchland Daniel Dennett focused primarily body rather mind
In context neuronal correlates may viewed causing consciousness consciousness thought undefined property depends upon complex adaptive highly interconnected biological system
However unknown discovering characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide theory consciousness explain first person experience systems determine whether systems equal complexity lack features
The massive parallelism neural networks allows redundant populations neurons mediate similar percepts
Nonetheless assumed every subjective state associated neural correlates manipulated artificially inhibit induce subject experience conscious state
The growing ability neuroscientists manipulate neurons using methods molecular biology combination optical tools achieved development behavioral organic models amenable large scale genomic analysis manipulation
Non human analysis combination imaging human brain contributed robust increasingly predictive theoretical framework
Arousal content There two common distinct dimensions term consciousness one involving arousal states consciousness involving content consciousness conscious states
To conscious something brain must relatively high state arousal sometimes called vigilance whether awake REM sleep
Brain arousal level fluctuates circadian rhythm natural cycles may influenced lack sleep alcohol drugs physical exertion etc
Arousal measured behaviorally signal amplitude required trigger given reaction example sound level causes subject turn look toward source
High arousal states involve conscious states feature specific perceptual content planning recollection even fantasy
Clinicians use scoring systems Glasgow Coma Scale assess level arousal patients impaired states consciousness comatose state persistent vegetative state minimally conscious state
Here state refers different amounts externalized physical consciousness ranging total absence coma persistent vegetative state general anesthesia fluctuating minimally conscious state sleep walking epileptic seizure Many nuclei distinct chemical signatures thalamus midbrain pons must function subject sufficient state brain arousal experience anything
These nuclei therefore belong enabling factors consciousness
Conversely likely specific content particular conscious sensation mediated particular neurons cortex associated satellite structures including amygdala thalamus claustrum basal ganglia
Historical background The following brief account contributions mind body problem
The Buddha The Buddha B C E founder Buddhism described mind body depending way two sheaves reeds stand leaning one another taught world consists mind matter work together interdependently
Buddhist teachings describe mind manifesting moment moment one thought moment time fast flowing stream
The components make mind known five aggregates e material form feelings perception volition sensory consciousness arise pass away continuously
The arising passing aggregates present moment described influenced five causal laws biological laws psychological laws physical laws volitional laws universal laws
The Buddhist practice mindfulness involves attending constantly changing mind stream
Ultimately Buddha philosophy mind forms conditionally arising qualities ever changing universe nirvāna attained phenomenal experience ceases exist
According anattā doctrine Buddha conceptual self mere mental construct individual entity basically impermanent illusion sustained form sensation perception thought consciousness
The Buddha argued mentally clinging views result delusion stress since according Buddha real self conceptual self basis standpoints views cannot found mind clarity
Plato Plato B C E
believed material world shadow higher reality consists concepts called Forms
According Plato objects everyday world participate Forms confer identity meaning material objects
For example circle drawn sand would circle participates concept ideal circle exists somewhere world Forms
He argued body material world soul world Forms thus immortal
He believed soul temporarily united body would separated death would return world Forms
Since soul exist time space body access universal truths
For Plato ideas Forms true reality experienced soul
The body Plato empty access abstract reality world experience shadows
This determined Plato essentially rationalistic epistemology
Aristotle For Aristotle BC mind faculty soul
Regarding soul said It necessary ask whether soul body one necessary ask whether wax shape one generally whether matter thing matter one
For even one spoken several ways properly spoken actuality
In end Aristotle saw relation soul body uncomplicated way uncomplicated cubical shape property toy building block
The soul property exhibited body one among many
Moreover Aristotle proposed body perishes soul shape building block disappears destruction block
Influences Eastern monotheistic religions In religious philosophy Eastern monotheism dualism denotes binary opposition idea contains two essential parts
The first formal concept mind body split may found divinity secularity dualism ancient Persian religion Zoroastrianism around mid fifth century BC
Gnosticism modern name variety ancient dualistic ideas inspired Judaism popular first second century AD
These ideas later seem incorporated Galen tripartite soul led Christian sentiments expressed later Augustinian theodicy Avicenna Platonism Islamic Philosophy
Thomas Aquinas Like Aristotle St Thomas Aquinas believed mind body one like seal wax one therefore pointless ask whether one
However referring mind soul asserted soul persists death body spite unity calling soul particular thing
Since view primarily theological rather philosophical impossible fit neatly within either category physicalist dualist
Descartes René Descartes believed mind exerted control brain via pineal gland My view gland principal seat soul place thoughts formed
The mechanism body constructed simply gland moved way soul cause drives surrounding spirits towards pores brain direct nerves muscles way gland makes spirits move limbs
His posited relation mind body called Cartesian dualism substance dualism
He held mind distinct matter could influence matter
How interaction could exerted remains contentious issue
Kant For Kant beyond mind matter exists world priori forms seen necessary preconditions understanding
Some forms space time examples today seem pre programmed brain
whatever impinges us mind independent world come located spatial temporal matrix The mind two pure forms intuition built allow organize manifold raw intuition
Kant views mind body interaction taking place forces may different kinds mind body
Huxley For Huxley conscious mind product brain influence upon brain called epiphenomenon
On epiphenomenalist view mental events play causal role
Huxley held view compared mental events steam whistle contributes nothing work locomotive
Whitehead A N Whitehead advocated sophisticated form panpsychism called David Ray Griffin panexperientialism
Popper For Popper three aspects mind body problem worlds matter mind creations mind mathematics
In view third world creations mind could interpreted second world mind used affect first world matter
An example might radio example interpretation third world Maxwell electromagnetic theory second world mind suggest modifications external first world
The body mind problem question whether thought processes World bound brain events World
I would argue first oldest attempted solutions one deserves taken seriously namely World World interact someone reads book listens lecture brain events occur act upon World reader listener thoughts conversely mathematician follows proof World acts upon brain thus upon World
This thesis body mind interaction
Searle For Searle b
mind body problem false dichotomy mind perfectly ordinary aspect brain
Searle proposed Biological naturalism
According Searle mind body problem macro micro economics problem
They different levels description set phenomena
But Searle careful maintain mental domain qualitative experience understanding autonomous counterpart microlevel redescription macroscopic features amounts kind evisceration See also General People John Searle William H Poteat References Bibliography Feigl Herbert

March Machines Why New Race Robots Will Rule World hardcover published paperback March Machines The Breakthrough Artificial Intelligence book Kevin Warwick
It presents overview robotics artificial intelligence AI often focusing anecdotes Warwick work imagines future scenarios
In particular Warwick finds likely AIs become smart enough replace humans humans may unable stop
Contents The book conversational style little technical detail
Warwick proposes machines become intelligent humans machine takeover inevitable
The drive automate fueled economic incentives
Even machines start without intentions take self modify direction toward survive likely resist turned
Arms races likely create ever increasing pressure greater autonomy robotic warfare systems pressure would hard curtail
Machines number advantages human minds including ability expand practically without limit spread space humans reach
All signs rapidly become merely insignificant historical dot p
Reception The book received poor reviews
John Durant New Statesman cautions Warwick apparent anthropomorphism In one problematic example passage Warwick opines Deep Blue computer deliberately let Kasparov win overall series shown first game really better player
Durant states There rather lot sort thing March Machines clear seriously intended taken
Durant also disagreed Warwick thesis stating present day computers threats us rather expressions power use machines use us
Durant also wonders If Warwick thesis impending world robot domination correct Warwick continues undertake cybernetic research Don Braben begins review Warwick book stating Specialists love share dire predictions future stem limited perspectives
Braben also states despite centrality intelligence thesis Warwick fails adequately pin slippery concept In Human Physiology Medvedev Aldasheva dispute Warwick contention machines become superior humans grounds machines man made human organs e extend humans
Moreover machines rebel humans humans could make use machines combat rebels
If AIs created humans would program align human goals AIs might go awry would different situation human maniacs
All told consider Warwick predictions robot rebellion grossly exaggerated The blurb edition stated part Recent breakthroughs cybernetics mean robots already exist brain power insects
Within five years robots exist brain power cats
In ten years robots exist intelligent humans

SHYSTER legal expert system developed Australian National University Canberra
It written doctoral dissertation James Popple supervision Robin Stanton Roger Clarke Peter Drahos Malcolm Newey
A full technical report expert system book detailing development testing also published
SHYSTER emphasises pragmatic approach posits legal expert system need based upon complex model legal reasoning order produce useful advice
Although SHYSTER attempts model way lawyers argue cases attempt model way lawyers decide cases use arguments
SHYSTER general design permitting operation different legal domains
It designed provide advice areas case law specified legal expert using bespoke specification language
Its knowledge law acquired represented information cases
It produces advice examining arguing similarities differences cases
It derives name Shyster slang word someone acts disreputable unethical unscrupulous way especially practice law politics
Methods SHYSTER specific example general category legal expert systems broadly defined systems make use artificial intelligence AI techniques solve legal problems
Legal AI systems divided two categories legal retrieval systems legal analysis systems
SHYSTER belongs latter category legal analysis systems
Legal analysis systems subdivided two categories judgment machines legal expert systems
SHYSTER belongs latter category legal expert systems
A legal expert system Popple uses term system capable performing level expected lawyer AI systems merely assist lawyer coming legal conclusions preparing legal arguments considered legal expert systems legal expert system must exhibit legal expertise
Designed operate one legal domain specific use common law Australia SHYSTER accounts statute law case law doctrine precedent areas private law
Whilst accommodates statute law primarily case based system contradistinction rule based systems like MYCIN
More specifically designed manner enabling linked rule based system form hybrid system
Although case based reasoning possesses advantage rule based systems elimination complex semantic networks suffers intractable theoretical obstacles without theory cannot predicted features case turn relevant
Users SHYSTER therefore require legal expertise
Richard Susskind argues jurisprudence ought supply models law legal reasoning required computerized sic implementation process building expert systems law Popple however believes jurisprudence limited value developers legal expert systems
He posits lawyer must model law maybe unarticulated includes assumptions nature law legal reasoning model need rest basic philosophical foundations
It may pragmatic model developed experience within legal system
Many lawyers perform work little jurisprudential knowledge evidence suggest worse better jobs lawyers well versed jurisprudence
The fact many lawyers mastered process legal reasoning without immersed jurisprudence suggests may indeed possible develop legal expert systems good quality without jurisprudential insight
As pragmatic legal expert system SHYSTER embodiment belief
A example SHYSTER pragmatism simple knowledge representation structure
This structure designed facilitate specification different areas case law using specification language
Areas case law specified terms cases attributes importance areas
SHYSTER weights attributes checks dependence
In order choose cases upon construct opinions SHYSTER calculates distances cases uses distances determine leading cases nearest instant case
To end SHYSTER seen adopt expand upon nearest neighbor search methods used pattern recognition
These nearest cases used produce argument based similarities differences cases likely outcome instant case
This argument relies doctrine precedent assumes instant case decided way nearest case
SHYSTER uses information nearest cases construct report
The report SHYSTER generates makes prediction justifies prediction reference cases similarities differences calculations SHYSTER performs coming opinion appear opinion
Safeguards employed warn users SHYSTER doubts veracity advice
Results SHYSTER tested four different disparate areas case law
Four specifications written representing area Australian law aspect law trover meaning authorization sic Australian copyright law categorisation employment contracts implication natural justice administrative decision making
SHYSTER evaluated five headings usefulness generality quality advice limitations possible enhancements could made
Despite simple knowledge representation structure shown capable producing good advice simple structure facilitated specification different areas law
Appreciating difficulties encountered legal expert systems developers adequately representing legal knowledge assist appreciating shortcomings digital rights management technologies
Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough permit exceptions copyright law
To end SHYSTER attempt model authorization sic Copyright Act viewed pioneering work field
The term authorization sic undefined Copyright Act
Consequently number cases courts seeking answers conduct amounts authorisation
The main contexts issue arisen analogous permitted exceptions copyright currently prevented digital rights management technologies home taping recorded materials photocopying educational institutions performing works public
When applied one case concerning compact cassettes SHYSTER successfully agreed Amstrad authorise infringement
SHYSTER MYCIN Popple highlighted obvious avenue future research using SHYSTER development rule based system linking together rule based system existing case based system form hybrid system
This intention eventually realised Thomas O Callaghan creator SHYSTER MYCIN hybrid legal expert system first presented ICAIL June Edinburgh Scotland MYCIN existing medical expert system adapted use SHYSTER
MYCIN controversial certainty factor used SHYSTER MYCIN
The reason difficulty scientifically establishing certain fact legal domain
The rule based approach MYCIN part used reason provisions Act Parliament
This hybrid system enables case based system SHYSTER determine open textured concepts required rule based system MYCIN
The ultimate conclusion joint endeavour hybrid approach preferred creation legal expert systems appropriate use rule based reasoning dealing statutes case based reasoning dealing cases

Pop music automation field study among musicians computer scientists goal producing successful pop music algorithmically
It often based premise pop music especially formulaic unchanging easy compose
The idea automating pop music composition related many ideas algorithmic music Artificial Intelligence AI computational creativity
Overview automation music Algorithms least formal sets rules used compose music centuries procedures used plot voice leading counterpoint example often reduced algorithmic determinacy
Now term usually reserved however use formal procedures make music without human intervention
Classical music automation software exists generates music style Mozart Bach jazz
Most notably David Cope written software system called Experiments Musical Intelligence EMI capable analyzing generalizing existing music human composer generate novel musical compositions style
EMI output convincing enough persuade human listeners music human generated high level competence
Creativity research jazz focused process improvisation cognitive demands places musical agent reasoning time remembering conceptualizing already played planning ahead might played next
Inevitably associated Pop music automation Pop music analysis
Projects Pop music automation may include limited ideas melody creation song development vocal generation improvement automatic accompaniment lyric composition
Automatic accompaniment Some systems exist automatically choose chords accompany vocal melody real time
A user musical experience create song instrumental accompaniment singing microphone
An example Microsoft Research project called Songsmith trains Hidden Markov model using music database uses model select chords new melodies
Melody generation Automatic melody generation often done Markov chain states system become note pitch values probability vector note constructed completing transition probability matrix see
An algorithm constructed produce output note values based transition matrix weightings could MIDI note values frequency Hz desirable metric
A second order Markov chain introduced considering current state also previous state indicated second table
Higher nth order chains tend group particular notes together breaking patterns sequences occasionally
These higher order chains tend generate results sense phrasal structure rather aimless wandering produced first order system
Lyric composition Automated lyric creating software may take forms Selecting words according rhythmThe Tra la Lyrics system produces song lyrics Portuguese given melody
This involves matching word syllable note melody also matching word stress strong beats melody
Parsing existing Pop music content word choice e g
This involves natural language processing
Pablo Gervás developed noteworthy system called ASPERA employs case based reasoning CBR approach generating poetic formulations given input text via composition poetic fragments retrieved case base existing poems
Each poem fragment ASPERA case base annotated prose string expresses meaning fragment prose string used retrieval key fragment
Metrical rules used combine fragments well formed poetic structure
Automatic analogy story creationPrograms like TALE SPIN The MINSTREL system represent complex elaboration basis approach distinguishing range character level goals story range author level goals story
Systems like Bringsjord BRUTUS create stories complex inter personal themes like betrayal

Overview As part reflection published Terry Winograd describes language action perspective resting two key orienting principles The first focus linguistic communication basis understanding occurs information systems
Ultimately information communication abstract system bits bytes means people interact
The second principle language action
Through linguistic acts people effect change world
In imposing language action framework information technology emphasize action dimension traditional dimension information content Language action argues speech simply composed assertions situation utterances may also create situation Let go park
That utterance may subject interpretation verifiable via state world
This principle closely linked ideas phenomenology
Furthermore language transmission information simply correspond state world
By creating situation language forms consensual domain encourage action language
These speech acts may often take form commitment actions In design information systems perspective based upon notion proposed Terry Winograd information technology may limited ability improve human communication

The Automated Mathematician AM one earliest successful discovery systems
It created Douglas Lenat Lisp led Lenat awarded IJCAI Computers Thought Award AM worked generating modifying short Lisp programs interpreted defining various mathematical concepts example program tested equality length two lists considered represent concept numerical equality program produced list whose length product lengths two lists interpreted representing concept multiplication
The system elaborate heuristics choosing programs extend modify based experiences working mathematicians solving mathematical problems
Controversy Lenat claimed system composed hundreds data structures called concepts together hundreds heuristic rules simple flow control AM repeatedly selects top task agenda tries carry
This whole control structure
Yet heuristic rules always represented separate data structures intertwined control flow logic
Some rules preconditions depended history otherwise could represented framework explicit rules What published versions rules often involve vague terms defined If two expressions structurally similar Rule replace value obtained similar value Rule Another source information user via Rule If user recently referred X boost priority tasks involving X
Thus appears quite possible much real discovery work buried unexplained procedures Lenat claimed system rediscovered Goldbach conjecture fundamental theorem arithmetic
Later critics accused Lenat interpreting output AM
In paper Why AM Eurisko appear work Lenat conceded system generated enough short Lisp programs would generate ones could interpreted external observer representing equally sophisticated mathematical concepts
However argued property interesting promising direction research would look languages short random strings likely useful
Depletion One key concepts espoused Lenat Which learned AM problem limited knowledge
AM simple set rules could discover new concepts
But time drew new discoveries became depleted
This effect confirmed Eurisko lead interest knowledge closure problem
It envisioned sufficiently complete set knowledge rules Human like intelligence would possible
Although seems even among natural intelligence closure requires knowledge people attain
This explained guest student Sheridan reason elections split
That In fact almost one ever reaches closure
Successor This intuition basis AM successor Eurisko attempted generalize search mathematical concepts search useful heuristics

Histogram Oriented Displacements HOD D trajectory descriptor
The trajectory described using histogram directions two consecutive points
Given trajectory T P P P Pn Pt D position time For pair positions Pt Pt calculate direction angle θ
Value θ
A histogram quantized values θ created
If histogram bins first bin represents θs
The histogram accumulates lengths consecutive moves
For θ specific histogram bin determined
The length line Pt Pt added specific histogram bin
To show intuition behind descriptor consider action waving hands
At end action hand falls
When describing movement descriptor care position hand started fall
This fall affect histogram appropriate angles lengths regardless position hand started fall
HOD records moving point much moves range directions
HOD clear physical interpretation
It proposes simple way describe motion object indicate much distance moves direction
If movement directions saved accurately movement repeated initial position final destination regardless displacements order
However temporal information lost order movements stored solve applying temporal pyramid shown section ref sec temp pyramid
If angles quantization range small classifiers use descriptor overfit
Generalization needs slack directions done increasing quantization range

Computer audition CA machine listening general field study algorithms systems audio understanding machine
Since notion means machine hear broad somewhat vague computer audition attempts bring together several disciplines originally dealt specific problems concrete application mind
The engineer Paris Smaragdis interviewed Technology Review talks systems software uses sound locate people moving rooms monitor machinery impending breakdowns activate traffic cameras record accidents
Inspired models human audition CA deals questions representation transduction grouping use musical knowledge general sound semantics purpose performing intelligent operations audio music signals computer
Technically requires combination methods fields signal processing auditory modelling music perception cognition pattern recognition machine learning well traditional methods artificial intelligence musical knowledge representation
Applications Like computer vision versus image processing computer audition versus audio engineering deals understanding audio rather processing
It also differs problems speech understanding machine since deals general audio signals natural sounds musical recordings
Applications computer auditions widely varying include search sounds genre recognition acoustic monitoring music transcription score following audio texture music improvisation emotion audio
Related disciplines Computer Audition overlaps following disciplines Music Information Retrieval methods search analysis similarity music signals
Auditory Scene Analysis understanding description audio sources events
Machine listening methods extracting auditory meaningful parameters audio signals
Computational musicology mathematical music theory use algorithms employ musical knowledge analysis music data
Computer music use computers creative musical applications
Machine musicianship audition driven interactive music systems
Areas study Since audio signals interpreted human ear brain system complex perceptual mechanism simulated somehow software machine listening
In words perform par humans computer hear understand audio content much humans
Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields electrical engineering spectrum analysis filtering audio transforms artificial intelligence machine learning sound classification psychoacoustics sound perception cognitive sciences neuroscience artificial intelligence acoustics physics sound production music harmony rhythm timbre
Furthermore audio transformations pitch shifting time stretching sound object filtering perceptually musically meaningful
For best results transformations require perceptual understanding spectral models high level feature extraction sound analysis synthesis
Finally structuring coding content audio file sound metadata could benefit efficient compression schemes discard inaudible information sound
Computational models music sound perception cognition lead meaningful representation intuitive digital manipulation generation sound music musical human machine interfaces
The study CA could roughly divided following sub problems Representation signal symbolic
This aspect deals time frequency representations terms notes spectral models including pattern playback audio texture
Feature extraction sound descriptors segmentation onset pitch envelope detection chroma auditory representations
Musical knowledge structures analysis tonality rhythm harmonies
Sound similarity methods comparison sounds sound identification novelty detection segmentation clustering
Sequence modeling matching alignment signals note sequences
Source separation methods grouping simultaneous sounds multiple pitch detection time frequency clustering methods
Auditory cognition modeling emotions anticipation familiarity auditory surprise analysis musical structure
Multi modal analysis finding correspondences textual visual audio signals
Representation issues Computer audition deals audio signals represented variety fashions direct encoding digital audio two channels symbolically represented synthesis instructions
Audio signals usually represented terms analogue digital recordings
Digital recordings samples acoustic waveform parameters audio compression algorithms
One unique properties musical signals often combine different types representations graphical scores sequences performance actions encoded MIDI files
Since audio signals usually comprise multiple sound sources unlike speech signals efficiently described terms specific models source filter model hard devise parametric representation general audio
Parametric audio representations usually use filter banks sinusoidal models capture multiple sound parameters sometimes increasing representation size order capture internal structure signal
Additional types data relevant computer audition textual descriptions audio contents annotations reviews visual information case audio visual recordings
Features Description contents general audio signals usually requires extraction features capture specific aspects audio signal
Generally speaking one could divide features signal mathematical descriptors energy description spectral shape etc statistical characterization change novelty detection special representations better adapted nature musical signals auditory system logarithmic growth sensitivity bandwidth frequency octave invariance chroma
Since parametric models audio usually require many parameters features used summarize properties multiple parameters compact salient representation
Musical knowledge Finding specific musical structures possible using musical knowledge well supervised unsupervised machine learning methods
Examples include detection tonality according distribution frequencies correspond patterns occurrence notes musical scales distribution note onset times detection beat structure distribution energies different frequencies detect musical chords
Sound similarity sequence modeling Comparison sounds done comparison features without reference time
In cases overall similarity assessed close values features two sounds
In cases temporal structure important methods dynamic time warping need applied correct different temporal scales acoustic events
Finding repetitions similar sub sequences sonic events important tasks texture synthesis machine improvisation
Source separation Since one basic characteristics general audio comprises multiple simultaneously sounding sources multiple musical instruments people talking machine noises animal vocalization ability identify separate individual sources desirable
Unfortunately methods solve problem robust fashion
Existing methods source separation rely sometimes correlation different audio channels multi channel recordings
The ability separate sources stereo signals requires different techniques usually applied communications multiple sensors available
Other source separation methods rely training clustering features mono recording tracking harmonically related partials multiple pitch detection
Auditory cognition Listening music general audio commonly task directed activity

AlphaZero computer program developed artificial intelligence research company DeepMind master games chess shogi go
The algorithm uses approach similar AlphaGo Zero
On December DeepMind team released preprint introducing AlphaZero within hours training achieved superhuman level play three games defeating world champion programs Stockfish elmo day version AlphaGo Zero
In case made use custom tensor processing units TPUs Google programs optimized use
AlphaZero trained solely via self play using first generation TPUs generate games second generation TPUs train neural networks parallel access opening books endgame tables
After four hours training DeepMind estimated AlphaZero playing higher Elo rating Stockfish hours training algorithm defeated Stockfish time controlled game tournament wins losses draws
The trained algorithm played single machine four TPUs
DeepMind paper AlphaZero published journal Science December
In DeepMind published new paper detailing MuZero new algorithm able generalise AlphaZero work playing Atari board games without knowledge rules representations game
Relation AlphaGo Zero AlphaZero AZ generalized variant AlphaGo Zero AGZ algorithm able play shogi chess well Go
Differences AZ AGZ include AZ hard coded rules setting search hyperparameters
The neural network updated continually
Go unlike chess symmetric certain reflections rotations AlphaGo Zero programmed take advantage symmetries
AlphaZero
Chess end draw unlike Go therefore AlphaZero take account possibility drawn game
Stockfish elmo Comparing Monte Carlo tree search searches AlphaZero searches positions per second chess shogi compared million Stockfish million elmo
AlphaZero compensates lower number evaluations using deep neural network focus much selectively promising variation
Training AlphaZero trained solely via self play using first generation TPUs generate games second generation TPUs train neural networks
In parallel training AlphaZero periodically matched benchmark Stockfish elmo AlphaGo Zero brief one second per move games determine well training progressing
DeepMind judged AlphaZero performance exceeded benchmark around four hours training Stockfish two hours elmo eight hours AlphaGo Zero
Preliminary results Outcome Chess In AlphaZero chess tournament Stockfish TCEC world champion program given one minute per move
Stockfish allocated threads hash size GB setting Stockfish Tord Romstad later criticized suboptimal
AlphaZero trained chess total nine hours tournament
During tournament AlphaZero ran single machine four application specific TPUs

Go After hours self learning Go AlphaGo Zero AlphaZero games lost
Analysis DeepMind stated preprint The game chess represented pinnacle AI research several decades
State art programs based powerful engines search many millions positions leveraging handcrafted domain expertise sophisticated domain adaptations
AlphaZero generic reinforcement learning algorithm originally devised game go achieved superior results within hours searching thousand times fewer positions given domain knowledge except rules
DeepMind Demis Hassabis chess player called AlphaZero play style alien It sometimes wins offering counterintuitive sacrifices like offering queen bishop exploit positional advantage
It like chess another dimension
Given difficulty chess forcing win strong opponent result significant margin victory
However grandmasters Hikaru Nakamura Komodo developer Larry Kaufman downplayed AlphaZero victory arguing match would closer programs access opening database since Stockfish optimized scenario
Romstad additionally pointed Stockfish optimized rigidly fixed time moves version used year old Similarly shogi observers argued elmo hash size low resignation settings EnteringKingRule settings cf
shogi Entering King may inappropriate elmo already obsolete compared newer programs
Reaction criticism Papers headlined chess training took four hours It managed little time breakfast lunch
Wired hyped AlphaZero first multi skilled AI board game champ
AI expert Joanna Bryson noted Google knack good publicity putting strong position challengers

It also political helps make Google strong possible negotiating governments regulators looking AI sector
Human chess grandmasters generally expressed excitement AlphaZero
Danish grandmaster Peter Heine Nielsen likened AlphaZero play superior alien species
Norwegian grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer characterized AlphaZero play insane attacking chess profound positional understanding
Former champion Garry Kasparov said It remarkable achievement even expected AlphaGo
Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura less impressed stated I necessarily put lot credibility results simply understanding AlphaZero basically using Google supercomputer Stockfish run hardware Stockfish basically running would laptop
If wanna match comparable Stockfish running supercomputer well
Top US correspondence chess player Wolff Morrow also unimpressed claiming AlphaZero would probably make semifinals fair competition TCEC engines play equal hardware
Morrow stated although might able beat AlphaZero AlphaZero played drawish openings Petroff Defence AlphaZero would able beat correspondence chess game either Motohiro Isozaki author YaneuraOu noted although AlphaZero comprehensively beat elmo rating AlphaZero shogi stopped growing point higher elmo
This gap high elmo shogi software able catch years
Final results DeepMind addressed many criticisms final version paper published December Science
They clarified AlphaZero running supercomputer trained using tensor processing units TPUs ran four TPUs core CPU matches
Chess In final results Stockfish version ran conditions TCEC superfinal CPU cores Syzygy endgame tablebases GB hash size
Instead fixed time control one move per minute engines given hours plus seconds per move finish game
In game match AlphaZero score wins losses rest drawn
DeepMind also played series games using TCEC opening positions AlphaZero also convincingly
Shogi Similar Stockfish Elmo ran conditions CSA championship
The version Elmo used WCSC combination YaneuraOu Early KPPT AVX TOURNAMENT
Elmo operated hardware Stockfish CPU cores GB hash size
AlphaZero games playing black plays first shogi overall
Reactions criticisms Human grandmasters generally impressed AlphaZero games Stockfish
Former world champion Garry Kasparov said pleasure watch AlphaZero play especially since plays open dynamic style Reactions computer chess community muted
Komodo developer Mark Lefler called pretty amazing achievement also pointed data old since Stockfish gained lot strength months since January Stockfish released
Fellow developer Larry Kaufman went claimed AlphaZero would probably lose match latest version Stockfish Stockfish TCEC conditions
Kaufman argued advantage neural network based engines used GPU one care power consumption e g
equal hardware contest engines access CPU GPU anything GPU achieves free
Based stated strongest engine likely hybrid uses neural networks standard alpha beta search Nonetheless AlphaZero inspired computer chess community develop Leela Chess Zero using techniques AlphaZero
Leela would go contest several championships Stockfish proven comparable strength

It treats board x image multiple channels
Each channel represents different aspect board information based upon specific style play
For standard extended play different channels respectively
In standard play players liberties represented six binary channels planes
The respective plane true player one two three liberties available
Ko e
illegal moves represented one binary plane
Stone placement opponent empty board positions represented three binary planes duration since stone placed represented real numbers two planes one player
Lastly opponents rank represented nine binary planes true player level true level forth
Extended play additionally considers boarder binary plane true border position mask represented distance board center e
x n c e displaystyle x distance x displaystyle x real number position player territory binary based player location closer
Darkfmct uses layer full convolutional network width nodes without weight sharing pooling
Each convolutional layer followed rectified linear unit popular activation function deep neural networks
A key innovation Darkfmct compared previous approaches uses one softmax function predict next move enables approach reduce overall number parameters
Darkfmct trained random selected games empirical dataset representing different game stages
The learning rate determined vanilla stochastic gradient descent
Darkfmct synchronously couples convolutional neural network Monte Carlo tree search
Because convolutional neural network computationally taxing Monte Carlo tree search focuses computation likely game play trajectories
By running neural network synchronously Monte Carlo tree search possible guarantee node expanded moves predicted neural network

LPA Lifelong Planning A incremental heuristic search algorithm based A
It first described Sven Koenig Maxim Likhachev
Description LPA incremental version A adapt changes graph without recalculating entire graph updating g values distance start previous search current search correct necessary
Like A LPA uses heuristic lower boundary cost path given node goal
A heuristic admissible guaranteed non negative zero admissible never greater cost cheapest path goal
Predecessors successors With exception start goal node node n predecessors successors Any node edge leads towards n predecessor n Any node edge leads n successors n In following description two terms refer immediate predecessors successors predecessors predecessors successors successors
Start distance estimates LPA maintains two estimates start distance g n node g n previously calculated g value start distance A rhs n lookahead value based g values node predecessors minimum g n n n n predecessor n x cost edge connecting x For start node following always holds true r h r g r displaystyle rhs start g start If rhs n equals g n n called locally consistent
If nodes locally consistent shortest path determined A
However edge costs change local consistency needs established nodes relevant route
Priority queue When node becomes locally inconsistent cost predecessor edge linking predecessor changed placed priority queue evaluation
LPA uses two dimensional key k n k n k n n g n r h n h n g l n g n r h n displaystyle k n begin bmatrix k_ n k_ n end bmatrix begin bmatrix min g n rhs n h n goal min g n rhs n end bmatrix Entries ordered k corresponds directly f values used A k
Node expansion The top node queue expanded follows If rhs value node equals g value node locally consistent removed queue
If rhs value node less g value known locally overconsistent node g value changed match rhs value making node locally consistent
The node removed queue
If rhs value node greater g value known locally underconsistent node g value set infinity makes node either locally overconsistent locally consistent
If node locally consistent removed queue else key updated Since changing g value node may also change rhs values successors thus local consistence evaluated queue membership key updated necessary
Expansion nodes continues next node top queue two conditions met The goal locally consistent The node top priority queue key greater equal key goal
Initial run The graph initialized setting rhs value start node g value infinity
For nodes g value rhs value assumed infinity assigned otherwise
This initially makes start node locally inconsistent node thus node queue
After node expansion begins
The first run LPA thus behaves manner A expanding nodes order
Cost changes When cost edge changes LPA examines nodes affected change e
nodes one changed edges terminates edge traversed directions change affects directions nodes connected edge examined The rhs values nodes updated
Nodes become locally consistent removed queue
Nodes become locally inconsistent added queue
Nodes remain locally inconsistent keys updated After node expansion resumes end condition reached
Finding shortest path Once node expansion finished e
exit conditions met shortest path evaluated
If cost goal equals infinity finite cost path start goal
Otherwise shortest path determined moving backwards Start goal
Move predecessor n current node n g n n n lowest lowest score shared multiple nodes valid solution chosen arbitrarily
Repeat previous step reached start
Pseudocode This code assumes priority queue queue supports following operations topKey returns numerically lowest priority node queue infinity queue empty pop removes node lowest priority queue returns insert node priority inserts node given priority queue remove node removes node queue contains node returns true queue contains specified node false Properties Being algorithmically similar A LPA shares many properties
Each node expanded visited twice run LPA
Locally overconsistent nodes expanded per LPA run thus initial run every node enters overconsistent state similar performance A visits node
The keys nodes expanded run monotonically nondecreasing time case A
The informed thus larger heuristics still satisfying admissibility criteria fewer nodes need expanded
The priority queue implementation significant impact performance A
Using Fibonacci heap lead significant performance increase less efficient implementations For A implementation breaks ties two nodes equal f values favor node smaller g value well defined A following statements also true The order locally overconsistent nodes expanded identical A
Of locally overconsistent nodes whose cost exceed goal need expanded case A LPA additionally following properties When edge costs change LPA outperforms A assuming latter run scratch fraction nodes need expanded

An energy based model EBM form generative model GM
GMs learn underlying data distribution analyzing sample dataset
Once trained GM produce datasets also match data distribution
EBMs provide unified framework many probabilistic non probabilistic approaches learning particularly training graphical structured models An EBM learns characteristics target dataset generates similar larger dataset
EBMs detect latent variables dataset generate new datasets similar distribution Target applications include natural language processing robotics computer vision
History Early work EBMs proposed models represented energy composition latent observable variables
EBMs surfaced
Approach EBMs capture dependencies associating unnormalized probability scalar energy configuration combination observed latent variables
Inference consists finding values latent variables minimize energy given set values observed variables
Similarly model learns function associates low energies correct values latent variables higher energies incorrect values Traditional EBMs rely stochastic gradient descent SGD optimization methods typically hard apply high dimension datasets
In OpenAI publicized variant instead used Langevin dynamics LD
LD iterative optimization algorithm introduces noise estimator part learning objective function
It used Bayesian learning scenarios producing samples posterior distribution EBMs require normalization without estimating normalization constant probabilistic models increasing flexibility Samples generated implicitly via Markov chain Monte Carlo approach
A replay buffer past images used LD initialize optimization module
Characteristics EBMs demonstrate useful properties Simplicity stability The EBM object needs designed trained
Separate networks need trained ensure balance
Adaptive computation time An EBM generate sharp diverse samples quickly coarse less diverse samples
Given infinite time procedure produces true samples
Flexibility In Variational Autoencoders VAE flow based models generator learns map continuous space possibly discontinuous space containing different data modes
EBMs learn assign low energies disjoint regions multiple modes

Optical mark recognition also called optical mark reading OMR process capturing human marked data document forms surveys tests
They used read questionnaires multiple choice examination paper form lines shaded areas
OMR background Many traditional OMR devices work dedicated scanner device shines beam light onto form paper
The contrasting reflectivity predetermined positions page used detect marked areas reflect less light blank areas paper
Some OMR devices use forms preprinted onto transoptic paper measure amount light passes paper thus mark either side paper reduce amount light passing paper
In contrast dedicated OMR device desktop OMR software allows user create forms word processor print laser printer
The OMR software works common desktop image scanner document feeder process forms filled
OMR generally distinguished optical character recognition OCR fact complicated pattern recognition engine required
That marks constructed way little chance reading marks correctly
This require image high contrast easily recognizable irrelevant shape
A related field OMR OCR recognition barcodes UPC bar code found product packaging
One familiar applications optical mark recognition use pencil HB Europe bubble optical answer sheets multiple choice question examinations
Students mark answers personal information darkening circles marked pre printed sheet
Afterwards sheet automatically graded scanning machine
In United States European countries horizontal vertical tick rectangular lozenge commonly used type OMR form familiar application United Kingdom UK National lottery form
Lozenge marks later technology advantage easier mark easier erase
The large bubble marks legacy technology early OMR machines insensitive large mark required reliability
In Asian countries special marker used fill optical answer sheet
Students likewise mark answers information darkening circles marked pre printed sheet
Then sheet automatically graded scanning machine
Many today OMR applications involve people filling specialized forms
These forms optimized computer scanning careful registration printing careful design ambiguity reduced minimum possible
Due extremely low error rate low cost ease use OMR popular method tallying votes OMR marks also added items physical mail folder inserter equipment used
The marks added normally facing odd page mail document consist sequence black dashes folder inserter equipment scans order determine mail folded inserted envelope
Optical answer sheet An optical answer sheet bubble sheet special type form used multiple choice question examinations
Optical mark recognition used detect answers
The well known company United States involved optical answer sheets Scantron Corporation although certain uses require customized system Optical answer sheets usually set blank ovals boxes correspond question often separate sheets paper
Bar codes may mark sheet automatic processing series ovals filled return certain value read
In way students answers digitally recorded identity given
Reading The first optical answer sheets read shining light sheet measuring much light blocked using phototubes opposite side
As phototubes mostly sensitive blue end visible spectrum blue pens could used blue inks reflect transmit blue light
Because number two pencils used fill bubbles graphite opaque substance absorbs reflects light hits Modern optical answer sheets read based reflected light measuring lightness darkness
They need filled number two pencil though recommended types due lighter marks made higher number pencils smudges number pencils
Black ink read though many systems ignore marks color form printed
This also allows optical answer sheets double sided marks made opposite side interfere reflectance readings much opacity readings
Most systems accommodate human error filling ovals imprecisely long stray ovals oval almost filled scanner detect filled
Errors It possible optical answer sheets printed incorrectly ovals read filled
This occurs outline ovals thick irregular
During U S presidential election occurred absentee ballots Georgia county Gwinnett discovered around already returned
The slight difference apparent naked eye detected test run made late October
This required ballots transferred correctly printed ones sequestered workers board elections close observation members Democratic Republican political parties county sheriff deputies
The transfer law could occur election day November
OMR software OMR software computer software application makes OMR possible desktop computer using Image scanner process surveys tests attendance sheets checklists plain paper forms printed laser printer
OMR software used capture data OMR sheets
While data capturing scanning devices focus many factors like thickness paper dimensions OMR sheet designing pattern
Commercial OMR software One first OMR software packages used images common image scanners Remark Office OMR made Gravic Inc originally named Principia Products Inc
Remark Office OMR released
The need OMR software originated early optical mark recognition systems used dedicated scanners special pre printed forms drop colors registration marks
Such forms typically cost US page
In contrast OMR software users design mark sense forms word processor built form editor print locally printer save thousands dollars large numbers forms Identifying optical marks within form processing census forms offered many forms processing Batch Transaction Capture companies since late
Mostly based bitonal image pixel count minimum maximum pixel counts eliminate extraneous marks erased dirty eraser converted black white image bitonal look like legitimate mark
So method cause problems user changes mind products started use grayscale better identify intent marker internally scantron NCS scanners used grayscale
OMR software also used adding OMR marks mail documents scanned folder inserter equipment
An example OMR software Mail Markup UK developer Funasset Limited
This software allows user configure select OMR sequence apply OMR marks mail documents prior printing
Open source OMR software Some OMR software developed distributed free open source licenses History Optical mark recognition OMR scanning paper detect presence absence mark predetermined position
Optical mark recognition evolved several technologies
In early th century th century patents given machines would aid blind OMR used input device data entry
Two early forms OMR paper tape punch cards use actual holes punched medium instead pencil filled circles medium
Paper tape used early input device telegraph
Punch cards created used input devices computers
The use punch cards declined greatly early introduction personal computers
With modern OMR presence pencil filled bubble recognized recognition done via optical scanner
The first mark sense scanner IBM Test Scoring Machine read marks sensing electrical conductivity graphite pencil lead using pairs wire brushes scanned page
In Richard Warren IBM experimented optical mark sense systems test scoring documented US Patents filed granted filed granted
The first successful optical mark sense scanner developed Everett Franklin Lindquist documented US Patent filed granted
Lindquist developed numerous standardized educational tests needed better test scoring machine standard IBM
The rights Lindquist patents held Measurement Research Center University Iowa sold operation Westinghouse Corporation
During period IBM also developed successful optical mark sense test scoring machine documented US Patent filed granted
IBM commercialized IBM Optical mark scoring reader
This variety related machines allowed IBM migrate wide variety applications developed mark sense machines new optical technology
These applications included variety inventory management trouble reporting forms dimensions standard punched card
While players educational testing arena focused selling scanning services Scantron Corporation founded different model would distribute inexpensive scanners schools make profits selling test forms
As result many people came think mark sense forms whether optically sensed scantron forms
Scantron operates subsidiary M F Worldwide MFW provides testing assessment systems services data collection analysis services educational institutions businesses government
In Westinghouse Learning Corporation acquired National Computer Systems NCS
In NCS acquired Pearson Education OMR technology formed core Pearson Data Management group
In February M F Worldwide purchased Data Management group Pearson group part Scantron brand OMR used many situations mentioned
The use OMR inventory systems transition punch cards bar codes used much purpose
OMR still used extensively surveys testing though
Usage The use OMR limited schools data collection agencies many businesses health care agencies use OMR streamline data input processes reduce input error
OMR OCR ICR technologies provide means data collection paper forms
OMR may also done using OMR discrete read head scanner imaging scanner
Applications There many applications OMR examples In process institutional research Community surveys Consumer surveys Tests assessments Evaluations feedback Data compilation Product evaluation Time sheets inventory counts Membership subscription forms Lotteries voting Geocoding e g
postal codes Mortgage loan banking insurance applications Field types OMR different fields provide format questioner desires
These fields include Multiple several options one chosen
For example form might ask one options ABCDE completely disagree disagree indifferent agree completely agree similar
Grid bubbles lines set grid format user fill phone number name ID number
Add total answers single value Boolean answering yes apply Binary answering yes one Dotted lines fields developed Smartshoot OMR allow border dropping like traditional color dropping
Capabilities requirements In past presently OMR systems require special paper special ink special input reader Bergeron
This restricts types questions asked allow much variability form input
Progress OMR allows users create print forms use scanner preferably document feeder read information
The user able arrange questions format suits needs still able easily input data
OMR systems approach one hundred percent accuracy take milliseconds average recognize marks
Users use squares circles ellipses hexagons mark zone
The software set recognize filled bubbles crosses check marks
OMR also used personal use
There one printers market print photos user selects filling bubbles size paper selection index sheet printed
Once sheet filled individual places sheet scanner scanned printer print photos according marks indicated
Disadvantages There also disadvantages limitations OMR
If user wants gather large amounts text OMR complicates data collection
There also possibility missing data scanning process incorrectly unnumbered pages lead scanned wrong order
Also unless safeguards place page could rescanned providing duplicate data skewing data As result widespread adoption ease use OMR standardized examinations consist primarily multiple choice questions changing nature tested

Activity recognition aims recognize actions goals one agents series observations agents actions environmental conditions
Since research field captured attention several computer science communities due strength providing personalized support many different applications connection many different fields study medicine human computer interaction sociology
Due many faceted nature different fields may refer activity recognition plan recognition goal recognition intent recognition behavior recognition location estimation location based services
Types Sensor based single user activity recognition Sensor based activity recognition integrates emerging area sensor networks novel data mining machine learning techniques model wide range human activities
Mobile devices e g
smart phones provide sufficient sensor data calculation power enable physical activity recognition provide estimation energy consumption everyday life
Sensor based activity recognition researchers believe empowering ubiquitous computers sensors monitor behavior agents consent computers better suited act behalf
Levels sensor based activity recognition Sensor based activity recognition challenging task due inherent noisy nature input
Thus statistical modeling main thrust direction layers recognition several intermediate levels conducted connected
At lowest level sensor data collected statistical learning concerns find detailed locations agents received signal data
At intermediate level statistical inference may concerned recognize individuals activities inferred location sequences environmental conditions lower levels
Furthermore highest level major concern find overall goal subgoals agent activity sequences mixture logical statistical reasoning
Sensor based multi user activity recognition Recognizing activities multiple users using body sensors first appeared work ORL using active badge systems early
Other sensor technology acceleration sensors used identifying group activity patterns office scenarios
Activities Multiple Users intelligent environments addressed Gu et al
In work investigate fundamental problem recognizing activities multiple users sensor readings home environment propose novel pattern mining approach recognize single user multi user activities unified solution
Sensor based group activity recognition Recognition group activities fundamentally different single multi user activity recognition goal recognize behavior group entity rather activities individual members within
Group behavior emergent nature meaning properties behavior group fundamentally different properties behavior individuals within sum behavior
The main challenges modeling behavior individual group members well roles individual within group dynamic relationship emergent behavior group parallel
Challenges must still addressed include quantification behavior roles individuals join group integration explicit models role description inference algorithms scalability evaluations large groups crowds
Group activity recognition applications crowd management response emergency situations well social networking Quantified Self applications
Approaches Activity recognition logic reasoning Logic based approaches keep track logically consistent explanations observed actions
Thus possible consistent plans goals must considered
Kautz provided formal theory plan recognition
He described plan recognition logical inference process circumscription
All actions plans uniformly referred goals recognizer knowledge represented set first order statements called event hierarchy
Event hierarchy encoded first order logic defines abstraction decomposition functional relationships types events Kautz general framework plan recognition exponential time complexity worst case measured size input hierarchy
Lesh Etzioni went one step presented methods scaling goal recognition scale work computationally
In contrast Kautz approach plan library explicitly represented Lesh Etzioni approach enables automatic plan library construction domain primitives
Furthermore introduced compact representations efficient algorithms goal recognition large plan libraries Inconsistent plans goals repeatedly pruned new actions arrive
Besides also presented methods adapting goal recognizer handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given sample individual recent behavior
Pollack et al
described direct argumentation model know relative strength several kinds arguments belief intention description
A serious problem logic based approaches inability inherent infeasibility represent uncertainty
They offer mechanism preferring one consistent approach another incapable deciding whether one particular plan likely another long consistent enough explain actions observed
There also lack learning ability associated logic based methods
Another approach logic based activity recognition use stream reasoning based Answer Set Programming applied recognising activities health related applications uses weak constraints model degree ambiguity uncertainty
Activity recognition probabilistic reasoning Probability theory statistical learning models recently applied activity recognition reason actions plans goals uncertainty
In literature several approaches explicitly represent uncertainty reasoning agent plans goals
Using sensor data input Hodges Pollack designed machine learning based systems identifying individuals perform routine daily activities making coffee
Intel Research Seattle Lab University Washington Seattle done important works using sensors detect human plans
Some works infer user transportation modes readings radio frequency identifiers RFID global positioning systems GPS
The use temporal probabilistic models shown perform well activity recognition generally outperform non temporal models
Generative models Hidden Markov Model HMM generally formulated Dynamic Bayesian Networks DBN popular choices modelling activities sensor data
Discriminative models Conditional Random Fields CRF also commonly applied also give good performance activity recognition Generative discriminative models pros cons ideal choice depends area application
A dataset together implementations number popular models HMM CRF activity recognition found
Conventional temporal probabilistic models hidden Markov model HMM conditional random fields CRF model directly model correlations activities observed sensor data
In recent years increasing evidence supported use hierarchical models take account rich hierarchical structure exists human behavioral data
The core idea model directly correlate activities sensor data instead breaks activity sub activities sometimes referred actions models underlying correlations accordingly
An example could activity preparing stir fry broken subactivities actions cutting vegetables frying vegetables pan serving plate
Examples hierarchical model Layered Hidden Markov Models LHMMs hierarchical hidden Markov model HHMM shown significantly outperform non hierarchical counterpart activity recognition
Data mining based approach activity recognition Different traditional machine learning approaches approach based data mining recently proposed
In work Gu et al problem activity recognition formulated pattern based classification problem
They proposed data mining approach based discriminative patterns describe significant changes two activity classes data recognize sequential interleaved concurrent activities unified solution
Gilbert et al
use D corners space time
These grouped spatially temporally using hierarchical process increasing search area
At stage hierarchy distinctive descriptive features learned efficiently data mining Apriori rule
GPS based activity recognition Location based activity recognition also rely GPS data recognize activities
Sensor usage Vision based activity recognition It important challenging problem track understand behavior agents videos taken various cameras
The primary technique employed computer vision
Vision based activity recognition found many applications human computer interaction user interface design robot learning surveillance among others
Scientific conferences vision based activity recognition work often appears ICCV CVPR
In vision based activity recognition great deal work done
Researchers attempted number methods optical flow Kalman filtering Hidden Markov models etc different modalities single camera stereo infrared
In addition researchers considered multiple aspects topic including single pedestrian tracking group tracking detecting dropped objects
Recently researchers used RGBD cameras like Microsoft Kinect detect human activities
Depth cameras add extra dimension e
depth normal camera fails provide
Sensory information depth cameras used generate real time skeleton model humans different body positions
These skeleton information provides meaningful information researchers used model human activities trained later used recognize unknown activities Despite remarkable progress vision based activity recognition usage actual visual surveillance applications remains distant aspiration
Conversely human brain seems perfected ability recognize human actions
This capability relies acquired knowledge also aptitude extracting information relevant given context logical reasoning
Based observation proposed enhance vision based activity recognition systems integrating commonsense reasoning contextual commonsense knowledge
Experiments performed using video RGBD cameras demonstrate added value approach
Levels vision based activity recognition In vision based activity recognition computational process often divided four steps namely human detection human tracking human activity recognition high level activity evaluation
Fine grained action localization In computer vision based activity recognition fine grained action localization typically provides per image segmentation masks delineating human object action category e g Segment Tube
Techniques dynamic Markov Networks CNN LSTM often employed exploit semantic correlations consecutive video frames
Automatic gait recognition One way identify specific people walk
Gait recognition software used record person gait gait feature profile database purpose recognizing person later even wearing disguise
Wi Fi based activity recognition When activity recognition performed indoors cities using widely available Wi Fi signals access points much noise uncertainty
These uncertainties modeled using dynamic Bayesian network model
In multiple goal model reason user interleaving goals deterministic state transition model applied
Another possible method models concurrent interleaving activities probabilistic approach
A user action discovery model could segment Wi Fi signals produce possible actions
Basic models Wi Fi recognition One primary thought Wi Fi activity recognition signal goes human body transmission causes reflection diffraction scattering
Researchers get information signals analyze activity human body
Static Transmission Model As shown wireless signals transmitted indoors obstacles walls ground human body cause various effects reflection scattering diffraction diffraction
Therefore receiving end receives multiple signals different paths time surfaces reflect signal transmission known multipath effect The static model based two kinds signals direct signal reflected signal
Because obstacle direct path direct signal transmission modeled Friis transmission equation P r P G G r λ π displaystyle P_ r frac P_ G_ G_ r lambda pi P displaystyle P_ power fed transmitting antenna input terminals P r displaystyle P_ r power available receiving antenna output terminals displaystyle distance antennas G displaystyle G_ transmitting antenna gain G r displaystyle G_ r receiving antenna gain λ displaystyle lambda wavelength radio frequency If consider reflected signal new equation P r P G G r λ π h displaystyle P_ r frac P_ G_ G_ r lambda pi h h displaystyle h distance reflection points direct path
When human shows new transmission path
Therefore final equation P r P G G r λ π h Δ displaystyle P_ r frac P_ G_ G_ r lambda pi h Delta Δ displaystyle Delta approximate difference path caused human body
Dynamic transmission model In model consider human motion causes signal transmission path change continuously
We use Doppler Shift describe effect related motion speed
Δ f v cos θ c f displaystyle Delta f frac v cos theta c f By calculating Doppler Shift receiving signal figure pattern movement thereby identifying human activity
For example Doppler shift used fingerprint achieve high precision identification nine different movement patterns
Fresnel zone The Fresnel zone initially used study interference diffraction light later used construct wireless signal transmission model
Fresnel zone series elliptical intervals whose foci positions sender receiver
When person moving across different Fresnel zones signal path formed reflection human body changes people move vertically Fresnel zones change signal periodical
In paper applied Fresnel model activity recognition task got accurate result
Modeling human body In tasks consider modeling human body accurately achieve better results
For example described human body concentric cylinders breath detection
The outside cylinder denotes rib cage people inhale inside denotes people exhale
So difference radius two cylinders represents moving distance breathing
The change signal phases expressed following equation θ π Δ λ displaystyle theta pi frac Delta lambda θ displaystyle theta change signal phases λ displaystyle lambda wavelength radio frequency Δ displaystyle Delta moving distance rib cage References Applications By automatically monitoring human activities home based rehabilitation provided people suffering traumatic brain injuries

Autonomic Networking follows concept Autonomic Computing initiative started IBM
Its ultimate aim create self managing networks overcome rapidly growing complexity Internet networks enable growth far beyond size today
Increasing size complexity The ever growing management complexity Internet caused rapid growth seen experts major problem limits usability future
What increasingly popular smartphones PDAs networked audio video equipment game consoles need interconnected
Pervasive Computing adds features also burdens existing networking infrastructure tasks sooner later manageable human intervention alone
Another important aspect price manually controlling huge numbers vitally important devices current network infrastructures
Autonomic nervous system The autonomic nervous system ANS part nervous system higher life forms consciously controlled
It regulates bodily functions activity specific organs
As proposed IBM future communication systems might designed similar way ANS
Components autonomic networking As autonomics conceptually derives biological entities human autonomic nervous system areas metaphorically related functional structural aspects living
In human body autonomic system facilitates regulates variety functions including respiration blood pressure circulation emotive response
The autonomic nervous system interconnecting fabric supports feedback loops internal states various sources internal external conditions monitored
Autognostics Autognostics includes range self discovery awareness analysis capabilities provide autonomic system view high level state
In metaphor represents perceptual sub systems gather analyze report internal external states conditions example might viewed eyes visual cortex perceptual organs system
Autognostics literally self knowledge provides autonomic system basis response validation
A rich autognostic capability may include many different perceptual senses
For example human body gathers information via usual five senses called sixth sense proprioception sense body position orientation emotive states represent gross wellness body
As conditions states change detected sensory monitors provide basis adaptation related systems
Implicit system imbedded models internal external environments relative value assigned perceived state perceived physical threat e g
snake result rapid shallow breathing related fight flight response phylogenetically effective model interaction recognizable threats
In case autonomic networking state network may defined inputs individual network elements switches network interfaces including specification configuration historical records current state traffic flows end hosts application performance data logical diagrams design specificationsMost sources represent relatively raw unprocessed views limited relevance
Post processing various forms analysis must applied generate meaningful measurements assessments current state derived
The autognostic system interoperates configuration management control network elements interfaces policy management define performance objectives constraints autodefense identify attacks accommodate impact defensive responses Configuration management Configuration management responsible interaction network elements interfaces
It includes accounting capability historical perspective provides tracking configurations time respect various circumstances
In biological metaphor hands degree memory autonomic system

Almost actions currently taken human engineers fall area
With exceptions interfaces set hand extension hand automated scripts
Implicit configuration process maintenance dynamic population devices management historical record changes directives invoked change
Typical many accounting functions configuration management capable operating devices rolling back changes recover previous configurations
Where change may lead unrecoverable states sub system able qualify consequences changes prior issuing
As directives change must originate sub systems shared language directives must abstracted details devices involved
The configuration management sub system must able translate unambiguously directives hard actions able signal need detail directive
An inferential capacity may appropriate support sufficient flexibility e
configuration never takes place unique one one mapping directive configuration settings
Where standards sufficient learning capacity may also required acquire new knowledge devices configuration
Configuration management interoperates sub systems including autognostics receives direction validation changes policy management implements policy models mapping underlying resources security applies access authorization constraints particular policy targets autodefense receives direction changes Policy management Policy management includes policy specification deployment reasoning policies updating maintaining policies enforcement
Policy based management required constraining different kinds behavior including security privacy resource access collaboration configuration management describing business processes defining performance defining role relationship establishing trust reputationIt provides models environment behavior represent effective interaction according specific goals
In human nervous system metaphor models implicit evolutionary design biological entities specific goals survival procreation
Definition constitutes policy necessary consider involved managing
A relatively flexible abstract framework values relationships roles interactions resources components network environment required
This sub system extends far beyond physical network applications use processes end users employ network achieve specific goals
It must express relative values various resources outcomes processes include basis assessing states conditions
Unless embodied system outside autonomic network implicit specific policy implementation framework must also accommodate definition process objectives goals
Business process definitions descriptions integral part policy implementation
Further policy management represents ultimate basis operation autonomic system must able report operation respect details implementation
The policy management sub system interoperates least indirectly sub systems primarily interacts autognostics providing definition performance accepting reports conditions configuration management providing constraints device configuration security providing definitions roles access permissions Autodefense Autodefense represents dynamic adaptive mechanism responds malicious intentional attacks network infrastructure use network infrastructure attack IT resources
As defensive measures tend impede operation IT optimally capable balancing performance objectives typically riding threat management actions
In biological metaphor sub system offers mechanisms comparable immune system
This sub system must proactively assess network application infrastructure risks detect identify threats define effective proactive reactive defensive responses
It role warrior security guard insofar roles maintenance corrective activities
Its relationship security close identical security concerned appropriately defined implemented access authorization controls maintain legitimate roles process
Autodefense deals forces processes typically malicious outside normal operation system offer risk successful execution
Autodefense requires high level detailed knowledge entire network well imbedded models risk allow analyze dynamically current status
Corrections decrease risk must considered balance performance objectives value process goals overzealous defensive response immobilize system like immune system inappropriately invoking allergic reaction
The detection network application behaviors signal possible attack abuse followed generation appropriate response example ports might temporarily closed packets specific source destination might filtered
Further assessment generates subsequent changes either relaxing defensive measures strengthening
Autodefense interoperates closely security receives definition roles security constraints defines risk proactive mitigation configuration management receives details network analysis directs changes elements response anticipated detected attack autognostics receives notification detected behaviorsIt also may receive definition relative value various resources processes policy management order develop responses consistent policy
Security Security provides structure defines enforces relationships roles content resources particularly respect access
It includes framework definitions well means implement
In metaphor security parallels complex mechanisms underlying social interactions defining friends foes mates allies offering access limited resources basis assessed benefit
Several key means employed security include well known As authentication authorization access control
The basis applying means requires definition roles relationships resources processes
High level concepts like privacy anonymity verification likely imbedded form role definitions derive policy
Successful security reliably supports enforces roles relationships
Autodefense close association security maintaining assigned roles balance performance exposes system potential violations security
In cases system must compensate making changes may sacrifice balance temporary basis indeed may violate operational terms security
Typically two viewed inextricably intertwined effective security somewhat hopefully negating need defensive response
Security revised role mediate competing demands policy maximized performance minimized risk auto defense recovering balance inevitable risk translates threat
Federation represents one key challenges solved effective security
The security sub system interoperates directly policy management receiving high level directives related access priority configuration management sending specifics access admission control autodefense receiving riding directives threat sending security constraint details risk assessment Connection fabric The connection fabric supports interaction elements sub systems autonomic system
It may composed variety means mechanisms may single central framework
The biological equivalent central nervous system although referred autonomic system actually communication conduit human body faculties
Principles autonomic networking Consequently currently research many research projects principles paradigms mother nature might applied networking
Compartmentalization Instead layering approach autonomic networking targets flexible structure termed compartmentalization
Function composition The goal produce architectural design enables flexible dynamic fully autonomic formation large scale networks functionalities constituent network node also composed autonomic fashion Atomization Functions divided atomic units allow maximal composition freedom

Neural modeling field NMF mathematical framework machine learning combines ideas neural networks fuzzy logic model based recognition
It also referred modeling fields modeling fields theory MFT Maximum likelihood artificial neural networks MLANS
This framework developed Leonid Perlovsky AFRL
NMF interpreted mathematical description mind mechanisms including concepts emotions instincts imagination thinking understanding
NMF multi level hetero hierarchical system
At level NMF concept models encapsulating knowledge generate called top signals interacting input bottom signals
These interactions governed dynamic equations drive concept model learning adaptation formation new concept models better correspondence input bottom signals
Concept models similarity measures In general case NMF system consists multiple processing levels
At level output signals concepts recognized formed input bottom signals
Input signals associated recognized grouped concepts according models level
In process learning concept models adapted better representation input signals similarity concept models signals increases
This increase similarity interpreted satisfaction instinct knowledge felt aesthetic emotions
Each hierarchical level consists N neurons enumerated index n N These neurons receive input bottom signals X n lower levels processing hierarchy
X n field bottom neuronal synaptic activations coming neurons lower level
Each neuron number synapses generality neuron activation described set numbers X n X n D
displaystyle vec X n X_ n D D number dimensions necessary describe individual neuron activation
Top priming signals neurons sent concept models Mm Sm n M S n M
displaystyle vec M _ vec S _ n M M number models
Each model characterized parameters Sm neuron structure brain encoded strength synaptic connections mathematically given set numbers S S A
displaystyle vec S _ S_ A
A number dimensions necessary describe individual model
Models represent signals following way
Suppose signal X n coming sensory neurons n activated object characterized parameters Sm
These parameters may include position orientation lighting object Model Mm Sm n predicts value X n signal neuron n For example visual perception neuron n visual cortex receives signal X n retina priming signal Mm Sm n object concept model Neuron n activated bottom signal lower level input top priming signal strong
Various models compete evidence bottom signals adapting parameters better match described
This simplified description perception
The benign everyday visual perception uses many levels retina object perception
The NMF premise laws describe basic interaction dynamics level
Perception minute features everyday objects cognition complex abstract concepts due mechanism described
Perception cognition involve concept models learning
In perception concept models correspond objects cognition models correspond relationships situations
Learning essential part perception cognition NMF theory driven dynamics increase similarity measure sets models signals L X M
The similarity measure function model parameters associations input bottom signals top concept model signals
In constructing mathematical description similarity measure important acknowledge two principles First visual field content unknown perception occurred Second may contain number objects
Important information could contained bottom signal Therefore similarity measure constructed accounts bottom signals X n L X n M S n n N l X n
displaystyle L vec X n vec M _ vec S _ n prod _ n N l vec X n
This expression contains product partial similarities l X n bottom signals therefore forces NMF system account every signal even one term product zero product zero similarity low knowledge instinct satisfied reflection first principle
Second perception occurs mind know object gave rise signal particular retinal neuron
Therefore partial similarity measure constructed treats model alternative sum concept models input neuron signal
Its constituent elements conditional partial similarities signal X n model Mm l X n
This measure conditional object present therefore combining quantities overall similarity measure L multiplied r represent probabilistic measure object actually present
Combining elements two principles noted similarity measure constructed follows L X n M S n n N M r l X n
displaystyle L vec X n vec M _ vec S _ n prod _ n N sum _ M r l vec X n
The structure expression follows standard principles probability theory summation taken alternatives various pieces evidence n multiplied
This expression necessarily probability probabilistic structure
If learning successful approximates probabilistic description leads near optimal Bayesian decisions
The name conditional partial similarity l X n simply l n follows probabilistic terminology
If learning successful l n becomes conditional probability density function probabilistic measure signal neuron n originated object Then L total likelihood observing signals X n coming objects described concept model Mm
Coefficients r called priors probability theory contain preliminary biases expectations expected objects relatively high r values true values usually unknown learned like parameters Sm
Note probability theory product probabilities usually assumes evidence independent
Expression L contains product n assume independence among various signals X n
There dependence among signals due concept models model Mm Sm n predicts expected signal values many neurons n During learning process concept models constantly modified
Usually functional forms models Mm Sm n fixed learning adaptation involves model parameters Sm
From time time system forms new concept retaining old one well alternatively old concepts sometimes merged eliminated
This requires modification similarity measure L The reason models always result better fit models data
This well known problem addressed reducing similarity L using skeptic penalty function Penalty method p N M grows number models M growth steeper smaller amount data N For example asymptotically unbiased maximum likelihood estimation leads multiplicative p N M exp Npar Npar total number adaptive parameters models penalty function known Akaike information criterion see Perlovsky discussion references
Learning NMF using dynamic logic algorithm The learning process consists estimating model parameters S associating signals concepts maximizing similarity L Note possible combinations signals models accounted expression L This seen expanding sum multiplying terms resulting MN items huge number
This number combinations signals N models M
This source Combinatorial Complexity solved NMF utilizing idea dynamic logic
An important aspect dynamic logic matching vagueness fuzziness similarity measures uncertainty models
Initially parameter values known uncertainty models high fuzziness similarity measures
In process learning models become accurate similarity measure crisp value similarity increases
The maximization similarity L done follows
First unknown parameters Sm randomly initialized
Then association variables f n computed f n r l X n M r l X n displaystyle f n frac r l vec X n sum _ M r l vec X n Equation f n looks like Bayes formula posteriori probabilities l n result learning become conditional likelihoods f n become Bayesian probabilities signal n originating object The dynamic logic NMF defined follows S n N f n ln l n M M S displaystyle frac vec S _ dt sum _ n N f n frac partial ln l n partial vec M _ frac partial vec M _ partial vec S _
f n f n M δ f n ln l n M M S S displaystyle frac df n dt f n sum _ M delta _ mm f n frac partial ln l n partial vec M _ frac partial vec M _ partial vec S _ frac vec S _ dt The following theorem proved Perlovsky Theorem
Equations define convergent dynamic NMF system stationary states defined max Sm L It follows stationary states MF system maximum similarity states
When partial similarities specified probability density functions pdf likelihoods stationary values parameters Sm asymptotically unbiased efficient estimates parameters
The computational complexity dynamic logic linear N Practically solving equations successive iterations f n recomputed every iteration using opposed incremental formula
The proof theorem contains proof similarity L increases iteration
This psychological interpretation instinct increasing knowledge satisfied step resulting positive emotions NMF dynamic logic system emotionally enjoys learning
Example dynamic logic operations Finding patterns noise exceedingly complex problem
If exact pattern shape known depends unknown parameters parameters found fitting pattern model data
However locations orientations patterns known clear subset data points selected fitting
A standard approach solving kind problem multiple hypothesis testing Singer et al

Since combinations subsets models exhaustively searched method faces problem combinatorial complexity
In current example noisy smile frown patterns sought
They shown Fig without noise Fig b noise actually measured
The true number patterns known
Therefore least patterns fit data decide patterns fit best
The image size example x points
If one attempts fit models subsets data points computation complexity MN
An alternative computation searching parameter space yields lower complexity pattern characterized parameter parabolic shape
Fitting x parameters x grid brute force testing would take operations still prohibitive computational complexity
To apply NMF dynamic logic problem one needs develop parametric adaptive models expected patterns
The models conditional partial similarities case described details uniform model noise Gaussian blobs highly fuzzy poorly resolved patterns parabolic models smiles frowns
The number computer operations example
Thus problem solvable due combinatorial complexity becomes solvable using dynamic logic
During adaptation process initially fuzzy uncertain models associated structures input signals fuzzy models become definite crisp successive iterations
The type shape number models selected internal representation within system similar input signals NMF concept models represent structure objects signals
The figure illustrates operations dynamic logic
In Fig
true smile frown patterns shown without noise b actual image available recognition signal noise signal noise ratio dB dB c initial fuzzy model large fuzziness corresponds uncertainty knowledge show improved models various iteration stages total iterations
Every five iterations algorithm tried increase decrease number models
Between iterations e algorithm decided needs three Gaussian models best fit
There several types models one uniform model describing noise shown variable number blob models parabolic models number location curvature estimated data
Until stage g algorithm used simple blob models g beyond algorithm decided needs complex parabolic models describe data
Iterations stopped h similarity stopped increasing
Neural modeling fields hierarchical organization Above single processing level hierarchical NMF system described
At level hierarchy input signals lower levels models similarity measures L emotions defined changes similarity actions actions include adaptation behavior satisfying knowledge instinct maximization similarity
An input level set signals X n neural terminology input field neuronal activations
The result signal processing given level activated models concepts recognized input signals n models along corresponding instinctual signals emotions may activate behavioral models generate behavior level
The activated models initiate actions
They serve input signals next processing level general concept models recognized created
Output signals given level serving input next level model activation signals defined n N f n
The hierarchical NMF system illustrated Fig

Within hierarchy mind concept model finds mental meaning purpose higher level addition purposes
For example consider concept model chair It behavioral purpose initiating sitting behavior sitting required body bodily purpose hierarchical level
In addition purely mental purpose higher level hierarchy purpose helping recognize general concept say concert hall model contains rows chairs
From time time system forms new concept eliminates old one
At every level NMF system always keeps reserve vague fuzzy inactive concept models
They inactive parameters adapted data therefore similarities signals low
Yet large vagueness covariance similarities exactly zero
When new signal fit well active models similarities inactive models automatically increase first every piece data accounted second inactive models vague fuzzy potentially grab every signal fit specific less fuzzy active models
When activation signal inactive model exceeds certain threshold model activated
Similarly activation signal particular model falls threshold model deactivated
Thresholds activation deactivation set usually based information existing higher hierarchical level prior information system resources numbers activated models various types etc
Activation signals active models particular level form neuronal field serve input signals next level abstract general concepts formed

A large amount research devoted extrapolating multiple training scenarios single training experience preserving past training diversity system become overtrained example presented series right turns learn always turn right
These issues common neural networks must decide amongst wide variety responses dealt several ways example randomly shuffling training examples using numerical optimization algorithm take large steps changing network connections following example grouping examples called mini batches
A K Dewdney former Scientific American columnist wrote Although neural nets solve toy problems powers computation limited I surprised anyone takes seriously general problem solving tool Dewdney p
Arguments Dewdney position implement large effective software neural networks much processing storage resources need committed
While brain hardware tailored task processing signals graph neurons simulating even simplified form Von Neumann technology may compel neural network designer fill many millions database rows connections consume vast amounts computer memory hard disk space
Furthermore designer neural network systems often need simulate transmission signals many connections associated neurons must often matched incredible amounts CPU processing power time
While neural networks often yield effective programs often cost efficiency tend consume considerable amounts time money
Arguments Dewdney position neural nets successfully used solve many complex diverse tasks autonomously flying aircraft Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented Dewdney statements neural nets Neural networks instance dock hyped high heaven

In spite emphatic declaration science technology Dewdney seems pillory neural nets bad science devising trying good engineers
An unreadable table useful machine could read would still well worth
Although true analyzing learned artificial neural network difficult much easier analyze learned biological neural network
Moreover recent emphasis explainability AI contributed towards development methods notably based attention mechanisms visualizing explaining learned neural networks
Furthermore researchers involved exploring learning algorithms neural networks gradually uncovering generic principles allow learning machine successful
For example Bengio LeCun wrote article regarding local vs non local learning well shallow vs deep architecture Some criticisms came believers hybrid models combining neural networks symbolic approaches

The purpose also test robustness CAPTCHA anti bot systems
Assistive technology blind visually impaired users Types Optical character recognition OCR targets typewritten text one glyph character time
Optical word recognition targets typewritten text one word time languages use space word divider
Usually called OCR
Intelligent character recognition ICR also targets handwritten printscript cursive text one glyph character time usually involving machine learning
Intelligent word recognition IWR also targets handwritten printscript cursive text one word time
This especially useful languages glyphs separated cursive script OCR generally offline process analyses static document
Handwriting movement analysis used input handwriting recognition
Instead merely using shapes glyphs words technique able capture motions order segments drawn direction pattern putting pen lifting
This additional information make end end process accurate
This technology also known line character recognition dynamic character recognition real time character recognition intelligent character recognition
Techniques Pre processing OCR software often pre processes images improve chances successful recognition
Techniques include De skew If document aligned properly scanned may need tilted degrees clockwise counterclockwise order make lines text perfectly horizontal vertical
Despeckle remove positive negative spots smoothing edges Binarisation Convert image color greyscale black white called binary image two colors
The task binarisation performed simple way separating text desired image component background
The task binarisation necessary since commercial recognition algorithms work binary images since proves simpler
In addition effectiveness binarisation step influences significant extent quality character recognition stage careful decisions made choice binarisation employed given input image type since quality binarisation method employed obtain binary result depends type input image scanned document scene text image historical degraded document etc
Line removal Cleans non glyph boxes lines Layout analysis zoning Identifies columns paragraphs captions etc
distinct blocks
Especially important multi column layouts tables
Line word detection Establishes baseline word character shapes separates words necessary
Script recognition In multilingual documents script may change level words hence identification script necessary right OCR invoked handle specific script
Character isolation segmentation For per character OCR multiple characters connected due image artifacts must separated single characters broken multiple pieces due artifacts must connected
Normalize aspect ratio scaleSegmentation fixed pitch fonts accomplished relatively simply aligning image uniform grid based vertical grid lines least often intersect black areas
For proportional fonts sophisticated techniques needed whitespace letters sometimes greater words vertical lines intersect one character
Character recognition There two basic types core OCR algorithm may produce ranked list candidate characters Matrix matching involves comparing image stored glyph pixel pixel basis also known pattern matching pattern recognition image correlation
This relies input glyph correctly isolated rest image stored glyph similar font scale
This technique works best typewritten text work well new fonts encountered
This technique early physical photocell based OCR implemented rather directly
Feature extraction decomposes glyphs features like lines closed loops line direction line intersections
The extraction features reduces dimensionality representation makes recognition process computationally efficient
These features compared abstract vector like representation character might reduce one glyph prototypes
General techniques feature detection computer vision applicable type OCR commonly seen intelligent handwriting recognition indeed modern OCR software
Nearest neighbour classifiers k nearest neighbors algorithm used compare image features stored glyph features choose nearest match Software Cuneiform Tesseract use two pass approach character recognition
The second pass known adaptive recognition uses letter shapes recognized high confidence first pass recognize better remaining letters second pass
This advantageous unusual fonts low quality scans font distorted e g
blurred faded The OCR result stored standardized ALTO format dedicated XML schema maintained United States Library Congress
For list optical character recognition software see Comparison optical character recognition software
Post processing OCR accuracy increased output constrained lexicon list words allowed occur document
This might example words English language technical lexicon specific field
This technique problematic document contains words lexicon like proper nouns
Tesseract uses dictionary influence character segmentation step improved accuracy The output stream may plain text stream file characters sophisticated OCR systems preserve original layout page produce example annotated PDF includes original image page searchable textual representation
Near neighbor analysis make use co occurrence frequencies correct errors noting certain words often seen together
For example Washington D C generally far common English Washington DOC
Knowledge grammar language scanned also help determine word likely verb noun example allowing greater accuracy
The Levenshtein Distance algorithm also used OCR post processing optimize results OCR API
Application specific optimizations In recent years major OCR technology providers began tweak OCR systems deal efficiently specific types input
Beyond application specific lexicon better performance may taking account business rules standard expression rich information contained color images

One study based recognition th early th century newspaper pages concluded character character OCR accuracy commercial OCR software varied total accuracy achieved human review Data Dictionary Authentication
Other areas including recognition hand printing cursive handwriting printed text scripts especially East Asian language characters many strokes single character still subject active research
The MNIST database commonly used testing systems ability recognise handwritten digits
Accuracy rates measured several ways measured greatly affect reported accuracy rate
For example word context basically lexicon words used correct software finding non existent words character error rate accuracy may result error rate accuracy worse measurement based whether whole word recognized incorrect letters An example difficulties inherent digitizing old text inability OCR differentiate long f characters Web based OCR systems recognizing hand printed text fly become well known commercial products recent years see Tablet PC history
Accuracy rates neat clean hand printed characters achieved pen computing software accuracy rate still translates dozens errors per page making technology useful limited applications Recognition cursive text active area research recognition rates even lower hand printed text
Higher rates recognition general cursive script likely possible without use contextual grammatical information
For example recognizing entire words dictionary easier trying parse individual characters script
Reading Amount line cheque always written number example using smaller dictionary increase recognition rates greatly
The shapes individual cursive characters simply contain enough information accurately greater recognize handwritten cursive script Most programs allow users set confidence rates
This means software achieve desired level accuracy user notified manual review

Optical mark recognition also called optical mark reading OMR process capturing human marked data document forms surveys tests
They used read questionnaires multiple choice examination paper form lines shaded areas
OMR background Many traditional OMR devices work dedicated scanner device shines beam light onto form paper
The contrasting reflectivity predetermined positions page used detect marked areas reflect less light blank areas paper
Some OMR devices use forms preprinted onto transoptic paper measure amount light passes paper thus mark either side paper reduce amount light passing paper
In contrast dedicated OMR device desktop OMR software allows user create forms word processor print laser printer
The OMR software works common desktop image scanner document feeder process forms filled
OMR generally distinguished optical character recognition OCR fact complicated pattern recognition engine required
That marks constructed way little chance reading marks correctly
This require image high contrast easily recognizable irrelevant shape
A related field OMR OCR recognition barcodes UPC bar code found product packaging
One familiar applications optical mark recognition use pencil HB Europe bubble optical answer sheets multiple choice question examinations
Students mark answers personal information darkening circles marked pre printed sheet
Afterwards sheet automatically graded scanning machine
In United States European countries horizontal vertical tick rectangular lozenge commonly used type OMR form familiar application United Kingdom UK National lottery form
Lozenge marks later technology advantage easier mark easier erase
The large bubble marks legacy technology early OMR machines insensitive large mark required reliability
In Asian countries special marker used fill optical answer sheet
Students likewise mark answers information darkening circles marked pre printed sheet
Then sheet automatically graded scanning machine
Many today OMR applications involve people filling specialized forms
These forms optimized computer scanning careful registration printing careful design ambiguity reduced minimum possible
Due extremely low error rate low cost ease use OMR popular method tallying votes OMR marks also added items physical mail folder inserter equipment used
The marks added normally facing odd page mail document consist sequence black dashes folder inserter equipment scans order determine mail folded inserted envelope
Optical answer sheet An optical answer sheet bubble sheet special type form used multiple choice question examinations
Optical mark recognition used detect answers
The well known company United States involved optical answer sheets Scantron Corporation although certain uses require customized system Optical answer sheets usually set blank ovals boxes correspond question often separate sheets paper
Bar codes may mark sheet automatic processing series ovals filled return certain value read
In way students answers digitally recorded identity given
Reading The first optical answer sheets read shining light sheet measuring much light blocked using phototubes opposite side
As phototubes mostly sensitive blue end visible spectrum blue pens could used blue inks reflect transmit blue light
Because number two pencils used fill bubbles graphite opaque substance absorbs reflects light hits Modern optical answer sheets read based reflected light measuring lightness darkness
They need filled number two pencil though recommended types due lighter marks made higher number pencils smudges number pencils
Black ink read though many systems ignore marks color form printed
This also allows optical answer sheets double sided marks made opposite side interfere reflectance readings much opacity readings
Most systems accommodate human error filling ovals imprecisely long stray ovals oval almost filled scanner detect filled
Errors It possible optical answer sheets printed incorrectly ovals read filled
This occurs outline ovals thick irregular
During U S presidential election occurred absentee ballots Georgia county Gwinnett discovered around already returned
The slight difference apparent naked eye detected test run made late October
This required ballots transferred correctly printed ones sequestered workers board elections close observation members Democratic Republican political parties county sheriff deputies
The transfer law could occur election day November
OMR software OMR software computer software application makes OMR possible desktop computer using Image scanner process surveys tests attendance sheets checklists plain paper forms printed laser printer
OMR software used capture data OMR sheets
While data capturing scanning devices focus many factors like thickness paper dimensions OMR sheet designing pattern
Commercial OMR software One first OMR software packages used images common image scanners Remark Office OMR made Gravic Inc originally named Principia Products Inc
Remark Office OMR released
The need OMR software originated early optical mark recognition systems used dedicated scanners special pre printed forms drop colors registration marks
Such forms typically cost US page
In contrast OMR software users design mark sense forms word processor built form editor print locally printer save thousands dollars large numbers forms Identifying optical marks within form processing census forms offered many forms processing Batch Transaction Capture companies since late
Mostly based bitonal image pixel count minimum maximum pixel counts eliminate extraneous marks erased dirty eraser converted black white image bitonal look like legitimate mark
So method cause problems user changes mind products started use grayscale better identify intent marker internally scantron NCS scanners used grayscale
OMR software also used adding OMR marks mail documents scanned folder inserter equipment
An example OMR software Mail Markup UK developer Funasset Limited
This software allows user configure select OMR sequence apply OMR marks mail documents prior printing
Open source OMR software Some OMR software developed distributed free open source licenses History Optical mark recognition OMR scanning paper detect presence absence mark predetermined position
Optical mark recognition evolved several technologies
In early th century th century patents given machines would aid blind OMR used input device data entry
Two early forms OMR paper tape punch cards use actual holes punched medium instead pencil filled circles medium
Paper tape used early input device telegraph
Punch cards created used input devices computers
The use punch cards declined greatly early introduction personal computers
With modern OMR presence pencil filled bubble recognized recognition done via optical scanner
The first mark sense scanner IBM Test Scoring Machine read marks sensing electrical conductivity graphite pencil lead using pairs wire brushes scanned page
In Richard Warren IBM experimented optical mark sense systems test scoring documented US Patents filed granted filed granted
The first successful optical mark sense scanner developed Everett Franklin Lindquist documented US Patent filed granted
Lindquist developed numerous standardized educational tests needed better test scoring machine standard IBM
The rights Lindquist patents held Measurement Research Center University Iowa sold operation Westinghouse Corporation
During period IBM also developed successful optical mark sense test scoring machine documented US Patent filed granted
IBM commercialized IBM Optical mark scoring reader
This variety related machines allowed IBM migrate wide variety applications developed mark sense machines new optical technology
These applications included variety inventory management trouble reporting forms dimensions standard punched card
While players educational testing arena focused selling scanning services Scantron Corporation founded different model would distribute inexpensive scanners schools make profits selling test forms
As result many people came think mark sense forms whether optically sensed scantron forms
Scantron operates subsidiary M F Worldwide MFW provides testing assessment systems services data collection analysis services educational institutions businesses government
In Westinghouse Learning Corporation acquired National Computer Systems NCS
In NCS acquired Pearson Education OMR technology formed core Pearson Data Management group
In February M F Worldwide purchased Data Management group Pearson group part Scantron brand OMR used many situations mentioned
The use OMR inventory systems transition punch cards bar codes used much purpose
OMR still used extensively surveys testing though
Usage The use OMR limited schools data collection agencies many businesses health care agencies use OMR streamline data input processes reduce input error
OMR OCR ICR technologies provide means data collection paper forms
OMR may also done using OMR discrete read head scanner imaging scanner
Applications There many applications OMR examples In process institutional research Community surveys Consumer surveys Tests assessments Evaluations feedback Data compilation Product evaluation Time sheets inventory counts Membership subscription forms Lotteries voting Geocoding e g
postal codes Mortgage loan banking insurance applications Field types OMR different fields provide format questioner desires
These fields include Multiple several options one chosen
For example form might ask one options ABCDE completely disagree disagree indifferent agree completely agree similar
Grid bubbles lines set grid format user fill phone number name ID number
Add total answers single value Boolean answering yes apply Binary answering yes one Dotted lines fields developed Smartshoot OMR allow border dropping like traditional color dropping
Capabilities requirements In past presently OMR systems require special paper special ink special input reader Bergeron
This restricts types questions asked allow much variability form input
Progress OMR allows users create print forms use scanner preferably document feeder read information
The user able arrange questions format suits needs still able easily input data
OMR systems approach one hundred percent accuracy take milliseconds average recognize marks
Users use squares circles ellipses hexagons mark zone
The software set recognize filled bubbles crosses check marks
OMR also used personal use
There one printers market print photos user selects filling bubbles size paper selection index sheet printed
Once sheet filled individual places sheet scanner scanned printer print photos according marks indicated
Disadvantages There also disadvantages limitations OMR
If user wants gather large amounts text OMR complicates data collection
There also possibility missing data scanning process incorrectly unnumbered pages lead scanned wrong order
Also unless safeguards place page could rescanned providing duplicate data skewing data As result widespread adoption ease use OMR standardized examinations consist primarily multiple choice questions changing nature tested

Color moments measures characterise color distribution image way central moments uniquely describe probability distribution
Color moments mainly used color indexing purposes features image retrieval applications order compare similar two images based color
Usually one image compared database digital images pre computed features order find retrieve similar Image
Each comparison images results similarity score lower score identical two images supposed
Overview Color moments scaling rotation invariant
It usually case first three color moments used features image retrieval applications color distribution information contained low order moments
Since color moments encode shape color information good feature use changing lighting conditions cannot handle occlusion successfully
Color moments computed color model
Three color moments computed per channel e g
moments color model RGB moments color model CMYK
Computing color moments done way computing moments probability distribution
Mean The first color moment interpreted average color image calculated using following formula E j N N p j displaystyle E_ textstyle sum _ j N frac N p_ ij N number pixels image p j displaystyle p_ ij value j th pixel image th color channel
Standard Deviation The second color moment standard deviation obtained taking square root variance color distribution
σ N j N p j E displaystyle sigma _ sqrt frac N textstyle sum _ j N p_ ij E_ E displaystyle E_ mean value first color moment th color channel image
Skewness The third color moment skewness
It measures asymmetric color distribution thus gives information shape color distribution
Skewness computed following formula N j N p j E displaystyle s_ sqrt frac N textstyle sum _ j N p_ ij E_ Kurtosis Kurtosis fourth color moment similarly skewness provides information shape color distribution
More specifically kurtosis measure extreme tails comparison normal distribution
Higher order color moments Higher order color moments usually part color moments feature set image retrieval tasks require data order obtain good estimate value also lower order moments generally provide enough information
Applications Color moments significant applications image retrieval
They used order compare similar two images
This relatively new approach color indexing
The greatest advantage using color moments comes fact need store complete color distribution
This greatly speeds image retrieval since less features compare
In addition first three color moments units allows comparison
Color indexing Color indexing main application color moments
Images indexed index contain computed color moments
Then someone particular image wants find similar images database color moments image interest also computed
After following function used order compute similarity score image interest images database H I r w E E w σ σ w displaystyle d_ mom H I textstyle sum _ r w_ E_ E_ w_ sigma _ sigma _ w_ s_ s_ H I color distributions two images compared channel index r total number channels E displaystyle E_ E displaystyle E_ first order moments computed image distributions
σ displaystyle sigma _ σ displaystyle sigma _ second order moments computed image distributions
s_i s_i third order moments computed image distributions
w displaystyle w_ w displaystyle w_ w displaystyle w_ weights specified user three color moments used Finally images database ranked according computed similarity score image interest database images lowest H I displaystyle d_ mom H I value retrieved
A retrieval based H I displaystyle d_ mom H I may produce false positives index contains information correlation color channels
Example A simple concise example use color moments image retrieval tasks illustrated Consider several test images database New Image
The goal retrieve images database similar New Image
The first three color moments used features
There several steps computation
Image preprocessing Optional The image preprocessing step computation process optional
For example step images could modified size terms pixels
However since color moments invariant scaling necessary make images width height
Computing features Use color moments formulae order compute first three moments color channels image
For example HSV color space used means images features total computed first three order moments Hue Saturation Value channels
Calculating similarity score After computing color moments weights moments H I displaystyle d_ mom H I function determined user
The weights adjusted time accordance application condition quality images
Following H I displaystyle d_ mom H I function used calculate similarity score New Image images database
Ranking image retrieval From previous step H I displaystyle d_ mom H I values obtained
Now comparison values made order decide images database similar New Image thus rank database images accordingly
The smaller H I displaystyle d_ mom H I value similar two color distributions supposed
Finally top ranked images ones smallest H I displaystyle d_ mom H I value database retrieved

Winner take computer science concept widely applied behavior based robotics method action selection intelligent agents
Winner take systems work connecting modules task designated areas way one action performed stops actions performed one action occurring time
The name comes idea winner action takes motor system power
History In many roboticists cognitive scientists attempting find speedier efficient alternatives traditional world modeling method action selection
In Jerome A Feldman D H Ballard published Connectionist Models Their Properties referencing explaining winner take method action selection
Feldman architecture functioned simple rule network interconnected action modules module set output zero reads higher input module
In Rodney Brooks introduced behavior based artificial intelligence
Winner take architectures action selection soon became common feature behavior based robots selection occurred level action modules bottom rather separate cognitive level top producing tight coupling stimulus reaction
Types winner take architectures Hierarchy In hierarchical architecture actions behaviors programmed high low priority list inhibitory connections action modules
The agent performs low priority behaviors higher priority behavior stimulated point higher behavior inhibits behaviors takes motor system completely
Prioritized behaviors usually key immediate survival agent behaviors lower priority less time sensitive
For example run away predator would ranked sleep
While architecture allows clear programming goals many roboticists moved away hierarchy inflexibility
Heterarchy fully distributed In heterarchy fully distributed architecture behavior set pre conditions met performed set post conditions true action performed
These pre post conditions determine order behaviors must performed used causally connect action modules
This enables module receive input modules well sensors modules recruit
For example agent goal reduce thirst behavior drink would require pre condition water available module would activate module charge find water
The activations organize behaviors sequence even though one action performed time
The distribution larger behaviors across modules makes system flexible robust noise
Some critics model hold existing set division rules predecessor conflictor connections modules produce sub par action selection
In addition feedback loop used model circumstances lead improper action selection
Arbiter centrally coordinated In arbiter centrally coordinated architecture action modules connected central arbiter
When behaviors triggered begin voting sending signals arbiter behavior highest number votes selected
In systems bias created voting weight often module allowed vote
Some arbiter systems take different spin type winner take using compromise feature arbiter
Each module able vote smaller action set actions arbiter selects action votes meaning benefits behavior modules
This seen violating general rule creating representations world behavior based AI established Brooks
By performing command fusion system creating larger composite pool knowledge obtained sensors alone forming composite inner representation environment
Defenders systems argue forbidding world modeling puts unnecessary constraints behavior based robotics agents benefits forming representations still remain reactive

Epistemic modal logic subfield modal logic concerned reasoning knowledge
While epistemology long philosophical tradition dating back Ancient Greece epistemic logic much recent development applications many fields including philosophy theoretical computer science artificial intelligence economics linguistics
While philosophers since Aristotle discussed modal logic Medieval philosophers Avicenna Ockham Duns Scotus developed many observations C I Lewis created first symbolic systematic approach topic
It continued mature field reaching modern form work Kripke
Historical development Many papers written spoke logic knowledge passing Finnish philosopher von Wright paper An Essay Modal Logic seen founding document
It another Finn Hintikka would write Knowledge Belief first book length work suggest using modalities capture semantics knowledge rather alethic statements typically discussed modal logic
This work laid much groundwork subject great deal research taken place since time
For example epistemic logic combined recently ideas dynamic logic create dynamic epistemic logic used specify reason information change exchange information multi agent systems
The seminal works field Plaza Van Benthem Baltag Moss Solecki
Standard possible worlds model Most attempts modeling knowledge based possible worlds model
In order must divide set possible worlds compatible agent knowledge
This generally conforms common usage
If I know either Friday Saturday I know sure Thursday
There possible world compatible knowledge Thursday since worlds either Friday Saturday
While primarily discussing logic based approach accomplishing task worthwhile mention primary method use event based approach
In particular usage events sets possible worlds knowledge operator events
Though strategies closely related two important distinctions made The underlying mathematical model logic based approach Kripke semantics event based approach employs related Aumann structures
In event based approach logical formulas done away completely logic based approach uses system modal logic Typically logic based approach used fields philosophy logic AI event based approach often used fields game theory mathematical economics
In logic based approach syntax semantics built using language modal logic describe
Syntax The basic modal operator epistemic logic usually written K read known epistemically necessary inconsistent known
If one agent whose knowledge represented subscripts attached operator K displaystyle mathit K _ K displaystyle mathit K _ etc
indicate agent one talking
So K φ displaystyle mathit K _ varphi read Agent displaystyle knows φ displaystyle varphi
Thus epistemic logic example multimodal logic applied knowledge representation
The dual K would relationship K displaystyle Diamond displaystyle Box specific symbol represented K φ displaystyle neg K_ neg varphi read displaystyle know φ displaystyle varphi It consistent displaystyle knowledge φ displaystyle varphi possible
The statement displaystyle know whether φ displaystyle varphi expressed K φ K φ displaystyle neg K_ varphi land neg K_ neg varphi
In order accommodate notions common knowledge distributed knowledge three modal operators added language
These E G displaystyle mathit E _ mathit G reads every agent group G knows C G displaystyle mathit C _ mathit G reads common knowledge every agent G D G displaystyle mathit D _ mathit G reads distributed knowledge every agent G If φ displaystyle varphi formula language E G φ displaystyle mathit E _ G varphi C G φ displaystyle mathit C _ G varphi D G φ displaystyle mathit D _ G varphi
Just subscript K displaystyle mathit K omitted one agent subscript modal operators E displaystyle mathit E C displaystyle mathit C D displaystyle mathit D omitted group set agents
Semantics As mentioned logic based approach built upon possible worlds model semantics often given definite form Kripke structures also known Kripke models
A Kripke structure M n agents Φ displaystyle Phi n tuple S π K


K n displaystyle S pi mathcal K _ mathcal K _ n S nonempty set states possible worlds π displaystyle pi interpretation associates state S truth assignment primitive propositions Φ displaystyle Phi K


K n displaystyle mathcal K _ mathcal K _ n binary relations S n numbers agents
It important confuse K displaystyle K_ modal operator K displaystyle mathcal K _ accessibility relation
The truth assignment tells us whether proposition p true false certain state
So π p displaystyle pi p tells us whether p true state model M displaystyle mathcal M
Truth depends structure current world well
Just something true one world mean true another
To state formula φ displaystyle varphi true certain world one writes M φ displaystyle M models varphi normally read φ displaystyle varphi true M M satisfies φ displaystyle varphi
It useful think binary relation K displaystyle mathcal K _ possibility relation meant capture worlds states agent considers possible
In idealized accounts knowledge e g describing epistemic status perfect reasoners infinite memory capacity makes sense K displaystyle mathcal K _ equivalence relation since strongest form appropriate greatest number applications
An equivalence relation binary relation reflexive symmetric transitive
The accessibility relation qualities certainly choices possible used modeling belief rather knowledge
The properties knowledge Assuming K displaystyle mathcal K _ equivalence relation agents perfect reasoners properties knowledge derived
The properties listed often known S Properties reasons described Axiom Systems section
The distribution axiom This axiom traditionally known K In epistemic terms states agent knows φ displaystyle varphi knows φ ψ displaystyle varphi implies psi agent must also know ψ displaystyle psi
So K φ K φ ψ K ψ displaystyle K_ varphi land K_ varphi implies psi implies K_ psi This axiom valid frame relational semantics
The knowledge generalization rule Another property derive ϕ displaystyle phi valid K ϕ displaystyle K_ phi
This mean ϕ displaystyle phi true agent knows ϕ displaystyle phi
What means ϕ displaystyle phi true every world agent considers possible world agent must know ϕ displaystyle phi every possible world
This principle traditionally called N φ M K φ
displaystyle text models varphi text M models K_ varphi This rule always preserves truth relational semantics
The knowledge truth axiom This axiom also known T It says agent knows facts facts must true
This often taken major distinguishing feature knowledge belief
We believe statement true false would impossible know false statement
K φ φ displaystyle K_ varphi implies varphi This axiom valid reflexive frame
The positive introspection axiom This property next state agent introspection knowledge traditionally known respectively
The Positive Introspection Axiom also known KK Axiom says specifically agents know know know
This axiom may seem less obvious ones listed previously Timothy Williamson argued inclusion forcefully book Knowledge Its Limits
K φ K K φ displaystyle K_ varphi implies K_ K_ varphi This axiom valid transitive frame
The negative introspection axiom The Negative Introspection Axiom says agents know know know
K φ K K φ displaystyle neg K_ varphi implies K_ neg K_ varphi This axiom valid Euclidean frame
Axiom systems Different modal logics derived taking different subsets axioms logics normally named important axioms employed
However always case
KT modal logic results combining K T Knowledge Generalization Rule primarily known S
This properties knowledge described often called S Properties
Epistemic logic also deals belief knowledge
The basic modal operator usually written B instead K In case though knowledge axiom longer seems right agents sometimes believe truth usually replaced Consistency Axiom traditionally called D B displaystyle neg B_ bot states agent believe contradiction false
When D replaces T S resulting system known KD
This results different properties K displaystyle mathcal K _ well
For example system agent believes something true actually true accessibility relation would non reflexive
The logic belief called doxastic logic
Problems possible world model modal model knowledge If take possible worlds approach knowledge follows epistemic agent knows logical consequences beliefs
If Q displaystyle Q logical consequence P displaystyle P possible world P displaystyle P true Q displaystyle Q
So knows P displaystyle P follows logical consequences P displaystyle P true possible worlds compatible beliefs
Therefore knows Q displaystyle Q
It epistemically possible Q displaystyle Q given knowledge P displaystyle P
This consideration part led Robert Stalnaker develop two dimensionalism arguably explain might know logical consequences beliefs even worlds propositions know come true consequences false Even ignore possible world semantics stick axiomatic systems peculiar feature holds
With K N Distribution Rule Knowledge Generalization Rule respectively axioms minimally true normal modal logics prove know logical consequences beliefs
If Q displaystyle Q logical consequence P displaystyle P derive K P Q displaystyle mathcal K _ P rightarrow Q N conditional proof K P K Q displaystyle mathcal K _ P rightarrow mathcal K _ Q K When translate epistemic terms says Q displaystyle Q logical consequence P displaystyle P knows knows P displaystyle P knows Q displaystyle Q
That say knows logical consequences every proposition
This necessarily true classical modal logics
But example knows prime numbers divisible number one knows prime since number divisible number one
That say modal interpretation knowledge knows definition prime number knows number prime
It clear point human
This shows epistemic modal logic idealized account knowledge explains objective rather subjective knowledge anything

Ethical considerations While interdisciplinary concept neuromorphic engineering relatively new many ethical considerations apply neuromorphic systems apply human like machines artificial intelligence general
However fact neuromorphic systems designed mimic human brain gives rise unique ethical questions surrounding usage
However practical debate neuromorphic hardware well artificial neural networks immensely simplified models brain operates processes information much lower complexity terms size functional technology much regular structure terms connectivity
Comparing neuromorphic chips brain crude comparison similar comparing plane bird wings tail
The fact neural cognitive systems many orders magnitude energy compute efficient current state art AI neuromorphic engineering attempt narrow gap inspiring brain mechanism like many engineering designs bio inspired features
Democratic concerns Significant ethical limitations may placed neuromorphic engineering due public perception
Special Eurobarometer Public Attitudes Towards Robots survey conducted European Commission found European Union citizens wanted ban robots care children elderly disabled
Furthermore favor ban robots education healthcare leisure
The European Commission classifies areas notably human The report cites increased public concern robots able mimic replicate human functions
Neuromorphic engineering definition designed replicate human function function human brain The democratic concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering likely become even profound future
The European Commission found EU citizens ages likely think robots human like opposed instrument like EU citizens age
When presented image robot defined human like EU citizens aged said corresponded idea robots EU citizens age responded way
The human like nature neuromorphic systems therefore could place categories robots many EU citizens would like see banned future
Personhood As neuromorphic systems become increasingly advanced scholars advocated granting personhood rights systems
If brain grants humans personhood extent neuromorphic system mimic human brain granted personhood rights
Critics technology development Human Brain Project aims advance brain inspired computing argued advancement neuromorphic computing could lead machine consciousness personhood
If systems treated people critics argue many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems including act termination neuromorphic systems may morally impermissible acts would violate autonomy neuromorphic systems However skeptics position argued way apply electronic personhood concept personhood would apply neuromorphic technology legally
In letter signed experts law robotics medicine ethics opposing European Commission proposal recognize smart robots legal persons authors write A legal status robot derive Natural Person model since robot would hold human rights right dignity right integrity right remuneration right citizenship thus directly confronting Human rights
This would contradiction Charter Fundamental Rights European Union Convention Protection Human Rights Fundamental Freedoms Ownership property rights There significant legal debate around property rights artificial intelligence
In Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd Justice Christopher Jessup Federal Court Australia found source code Material Safety Data Sheets could copyrighted generated software interface rather human author
The question may apply neuromorphic systems neuromorphic system successfully mimics human brain produces piece original work anyone able claim ownership work

Arbitrary global optimization techniques may used minimize target function
The common global optimization method training RNNs genetic algorithms especially unstructured networks Initially genetic algorithm encoded neural network weights predefined manner one gene chromosome represents one weight link
The whole network represented single chromosome
The fitness function evaluated follows Each weight encoded chromosome assigned respective weight link network
The training set presented network propagates input signals forward
The mean squared error returned fitness function
This function drives genetic selection process Many chromosomes make population therefore many different neural networks evolved stopping criterion satisfied
A common stopping scheme When neural network learnt certain percentage training data When minimum value mean squared error satisfied When maximum number training generations reached The stopping criterion evaluated fitness function gets reciprocal mean squared error network training
Therefore goal genetic algorithm maximize fitness function reducing mean squared error

Collective intelligence CI shared group intelligence emerges collaboration collective efforts competition many individuals appears consensus decision making
The term appears sociobiology political science context mass peer review crowdsourcing applications
It may involve consensus social capital formalisms voting systems social media means quantifying mass activity
Collective IQ measure collective intelligence although often used interchangeably term collective intelligence
Collective intelligence also attributed bacteria animals It understood emergent property synergies among data information knowledge software hardware experts new insights well recognized authorities continually learns feedback produce time knowledge better decisions three elements acting alone
Or narrowly emergent property people ways processing information
This notion collective intelligence referred symbiotic intelligence Norman Lee Johnson
The concept used sociology business computer science mass communications also appears science fiction
Pierre Lévy defines collective intelligence It form universally distributed intelligence constantly enhanced coordinated real time resulting effective mobilization skills
I add following indispensable characteristic definition The basis goal collective intelligence mutual recognition enrichment individuals rather cult fetishized hypostatized communities
According researchers Pierre Lévy Derrick de Kerckhove refers capacity networked ICTs Information communication technologies enhance collective pool social knowledge simultaneously expanding extent human interactions Collective intelligence strongly contributes shift knowledge power individual collective
According Eric S Raymond JC Herz open source intelligence eventually generate superior outcomes knowledge generated proprietary software developed within corporations Flew
Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence alternative source media power related convergence culture
He draws attention education way people learning participate knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings
Henry Jenkins criticizes schools promote autonomous problem solvers self contained learners remaining hostile learning means collective intelligence
Both Pierre Lévy Henry Jenkins support claim collective intelligence important democratization interlinked knowledge based culture sustained collective idea sharing thus contributes better understanding diverse society
Similar g factor g general individual intelligence new scientific understanding collective intelligence aims extract general collective intelligence factor c factor groups indicating group ability perform wide range tasks
Definition operationalization statistical methods derived g Similarly g highly interrelated concept IQ measurement collective intelligence interpreted intelligence quotient groups Group IQ even though score quotient per se
Causes c predictive validity investigated well
Writers influenced idea collective intelligence include Francis Galton Douglas Hofstadter Peter Russell Tom Atlee Pierre Lévy Howard Bloom Francis Heylighen Douglas Engelbart Louis Rosenberg Cliff Joslyn Ron Dembo Gottfried Mayer Kress
History The concept although named originated Marquis de Condorcet whose jury theorem states member voting group likely make correct decision probability highest vote group correct decision increases number members group see Condorcet jury theorem
Many theorists interpreted Aristotle statement Politics feast many contribute better dinner provided single purse mean many may bring different dishes table deliberation many may contribute different pieces information generate better decision
Recent scholarship however suggests probably Aristotle meant modern interpretation based know team intelligence A precursor concept found entomologist William Morton Wheeler observation seemingly independent individuals cooperate closely become indistinguishable single organism
Wheeler saw collaborative process work ants acted like cells single beast called superorganism

Atlee Pór state collective intelligence also involves achieving single focus attention standard metrics provide appropriate threshold action
Their approach rooted scientific community metaphor The term group intelligence sometimes used interchangeably term collective intelligence
Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence measure group intelligence group creativity
The idea measure collective intelligence covers broad range features group mainly group composition group interaction
The features composition lead increased levels collective intelligence groups include criteria higher numbers women group well increased diversity group Atlee Pór suggest field collective intelligence primarily seen human enterprise mind sets willingness share openness value distributed intelligence common good paramount though group theory artificial intelligence something offer

Collective intelligence factor c A new scientific understanding collective intelligence defines group general ability perform wide range tasks
Definition operationalization statistical methods similar psychometric approach general individual intelligence
Hereby individual performance given set cognitive tasks used measure general cognitive ability indicated general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis
In vein g serves display individual performance differences cognitive tasks collective intelligence research aims find parallel intelligence factor groups c factor also called collective intelligence factor CI displaying group differences task performance
The collective intelligence score used predict group perform similar task future
Yet tasks hereby refer mental intellectual tasks performed small groups even though concept hoped transferable performances groups crowds reaching families companies even whole cities
Since individuals g factor scores highly correlated full scale IQ scores turn regarded good estimates g measurement collective intelligence also seen intelligence indicator quotient respectively group Group IQ parallel individual intelligence quotient IQ even though score quotient per se
Mathematically c g variables summarizing positive correlations among different tasks supposing performance one task comparable performance similar tasks
c thus source variance among groups considered group standing c factor compared groups given relevant population
The concept contrast competing hypotheses including correlational structures explain group intelligence composition several equally important independent factors found individual personality research Besides scientific idea also aims explore causes affecting collective intelligence group size collaboration tools group members interpersonal skills
The MIT Center Collective Intelligence instance announced detection The Genome Collective Intelligence one main goals aiming develop taxonomy organizational building blocks genes combined recombined harness intelligence crowds
Causes Individual intelligence shown genetically environmentally influenced
Analogously collective intelligence research aims explore reasons certain groups perform intelligent groups given c moderately correlated intelligence individual group members
According Woolley et al
results neither team cohesion motivation satisfaction correlated c However claim three factors found significant correlates variance number speaking turns group members average social sensitivity proportion females
All three similar predictive power c social sensitivity statistically significant b P The number speaking turns indicates groups people dominated conversation less collectively intelligent equal distribution conversational turn taking
Hence providing multiple team members chance speak made group intelligent Group members social sensitivity measured via Reading Mind Eyes Test RME correlated c Hereby participants asked detect thinking feeling expressed peoples eyes presented pictures assessed multiple choice format
The test aims measure peoples theory mind ToM also called mentalizing mind reading refers ability attribute mental states beliefs desires intents people far people understand others beliefs desires intentions perspectives different ones
RME ToM test adults shows sufficient test retest reliability constantly differentiates control groups individuals functional autism Asperger Syndrome
It one widely accepted well validated tests ToM within adults
ToM regarded associated subset skills abilities within broader concept emotional intelligence The proportion females predictor c largely mediated social sensitivity Sobel z P vein previous research showing women score higher social sensitivity tests
While mediation statistically speaking clarifies mechanism underlying relationship dependent independent variable Wolley agreed interview Harvard Business Review findings saying groups women smarter groups men
However relativizes stating actual important thing high social sensitivity group members It theorized collective intelligence factor c emergent property resulting bottom well top processes
Hereby bottom processes cover aggregated group member characteristics
Top processes cover group structures norms influence group way collaborating coordinating
Processes Top processes Top processes cover group interaction structures processes norms
An example top processes conversational turn taking
Research suggest collectively intelligent groups communicate general well equally applies participation shown face face well online groups communicating via writing
Bottom processes Bottom processes include group composition namely characteristics group members aggregated team level
An example bottom processes average social sensitivity average maximum intelligence scores group members
Furthermore collective intelligence found related group cognitive diversity including thinking styles perspectives
Groups moderately diverse cognitive style higher collective intelligence similar cognitive style different
Consequently groups members similar lack variety perspectives skills needed perform well
On hand groups whose members different seem difficulties communicate coordinate effectively
Serial vs Parallel processes For human history collective intelligence confined small tribal groups opinions aggregated real time parallel interactions among members
In modern times mass communication mass media networking technologies enabled collective intelligence span massive groups distributed across continents time zones
To accommodate shift scale collective intelligence large scale groups dominated serialized polling processes aggregating votes likes ratings time
While modern systems benefit larger group size serialized process found introduce substantial noise distorts collective output group
In one significant study serialized collective intelligence found first vote contributed serialized voting system distort final result To address problems serialized aggregation input among large scale groups recent advancements collective intelligence worked replace serialized votes polls markets parallel systems human swarms modeled synchronous swarms nature
Based natural process Swarm Intelligence artificial swarms networked humans enable participants work together parallel answer questions make predictions emergent collective intelligence
In one high profile example human swarm challenge CBS Interactive predict Kentucky Derby
The swarm correctly predicted first four horses order defying odds turning bet The value parallel collective intelligence demonstrated medical applications researchers Stanford University School Medicine Unanimous AI set published studies wherein groups human doctors connected real time swarming algorithms tasked diagnosing chest x rays presence pneumonia
When working together human swarms groups experienced radiologists demonstrated reduction diagnostic errors compared traditional methods
Evidence Woolley Chabris Pentland Hashmi Malone originators scientific understanding collective intelligence found single statistical factor collective intelligence research across groups people randomly recruited public
In Woolley et al
two initial studies groups worked together different tasks McGrath Task Circumplex well established taxonomy group tasks
Tasks chosen four quadrants circumplex included visual puzzles brainstorming making collective moral judgments negotiating limited resources
The results tasks taken conduct factor analysis
Both studies showed support general collective intelligence factor c underlying differences group performance initial eigenvalue accounting study variance whereas next factor accounted
That fits range normally found research regarding general individual intelligence factor g typically accounting percent individual performance differences cognitive tests Afterwards complex criterion task absolved group measuring whether extracted c factor predictive power performance outside original task batteries
Criterion tasks playing checkers draughts standardized computer first complex architectural design task second study
In regression analysis using individual intelligence group members c predict performance criterion tasks c significant effect average maximum individual intelligence
While average r P maximum intelligence r P individual group members moderately correlated c c still much better predictor criterion tasks
According Woolley et al supports existence collective intelligence factor c demonstrates effect beyond group members individual intelligence thus c aggregation individual IQs influence group member highest IQ Engel et al
replicated Woolley et al
findings applying accelerated battery tasks first factor factor analysis explaining group variance performance following factors explaining less half amount
Moreover found similar result groups working together online communicating via text confirmed role female proportion social sensitivity causing collective intelligence cases
Similarly Wolley et al also measured social sensitivity RME actually meant measure people ability detect mental states peoples eyes
The online collaborating participants however neither know see
The authors conclude scores RME must related broader set abilities social reasoning drawing inferences people eye expressions A collective intelligence factor c sense Woolley et al
found groups MBA students working together course semester online gaming groups well groups different cultures groups different contexts terms short term versus long term groups
None investigations considered team members individual intelligence scores control variables Note well field collective intelligence research quite young published empirical evidence relatively rare yet
However various proposals working papers progress already completed supposedly still scholarly peer reviewing publication process
Predictive validity Next predicting group performance complex criterion tasks shown original experiments collective intelligence factor c also found predict group performance diverse tasks MBA classes lasting several months
Thereby highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores group assignments although members better individually performed assignments
Moreover highly collective intelligent teams improved performance time suggesting collectively intelligent teams learn better
This another potential parallel individual intelligence intelligent people found acquire new material quicker Individual intelligence used predict plenty life outcomes school attainment career success health outcomes even mortality
Whether collective intelligence able predict outcomes besides group performance mental tasks still investigated
Potential connections individual intelligence Gladwell showed relationship individual IQ success works certain point additional IQ points estimate IQ translate real life advantages
If similar border exists Group IQ advantages linear infinite still explored
Similarly demand research possible connections individual collective intelligence exists within plenty potentially transferable logics individual intelligence instance development time question improving intelligence
Whereas controversial whether human intelligence enhanced via training group collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities improvement exchanging team members implementing structures technologies
Moreover social sensitivity found least temporarily improvable reading literary fiction well watching drama movies
In far training ultimately improves collective intelligence social sensitivity remains open question There advanced concepts factor models attempting explain individual cognitive ability including categorization intelligence fluid crystallized intelligence hierarchical model intelligence differences
Further supplementing explanations conceptualizations factor structure Genomes collective intelligence besides general c factor though missing yet
Controversies Other scholars explain team performance aggregating team members general intelligence team level instead building overall collective intelligence measure
Devine Philips showed meta analysis mean cognitive ability predicts team performance laboratory settings well field settings note small effect
Suggesting strong dependence relevant tasks scholars showed tasks requiring high degree communication cooperation found influenced team member lowest cognitive ability
Tasks selecting best team member successful strategy shown influenced member highest cognitive ability Since Woolley et al
results show influence group satisfaction group cohesiveness motivation least implicitly challenge concepts regarding importance group performance general thus contrast meta analytically proven evidence concerning positive effects group cohesion motivation satisfaction group performance
Noteworthy also involved researchers among confirming findings widely overlap authors participating original first study around Anita Woolley
Alternative mathematical techniques Computational collective intelligence In Tadeusz Tad Szuba AGH University Poland proposed formal model phenomenon collective intelligence
It assumed unconscious random parallel distributed computational process run mathematical logic social structure In model beings information modeled abstract information molecules carrying expressions mathematical logic
They quasi randomly displacing due interaction environments intended displacements
Their interaction abstract computational space creates multi thread inference process perceive collective intelligence

DeepDream computer vision program created Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev uses convolutional neural network find enhance patterns images via algorithmic pareidolia thus creating dream like hallucinogenic appearance deliberately processed images Google program popularized term deep dreaming refer generation images produce desired activations trained deep network term refers collection related approaches
History The DeepDream software originated deep convolutional network codenamed Inception film name developed ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ILSVRC released July
The dreaming idea name became popular internet thanks Google DeepDream program
The idea dates early history neural networks similar methods used synthesize visual textures
Related visualization ideas developed prior Google work several research groups After Google published techniques made code open source number tools form web services mobile applications desktop software appeared market enable users transform photos
Process The software designed detect faces patterns images aim automatically classifying images
However trained network also run reverse asked adjust original image slightly given output neuron e g
one faces certain animals yields higher confidence score
This used visualizations understand emergent structure neural network better basis DeepDream concept
However enough reiterations even imagery initially devoid sought features adjusted enough form pareidolia results psychedelic surreal images generated algorithmically
The optimization resembles Backpropagation however instead adjusting network weights weights held fixed input adjusted
For example existing image altered cat like resulting enhanced image input procedure
This usage resembles activity looking animals patterns clouds
Applying gradient descent independently pixel input produces images adjacent pixels little relation thus image much high frequency information
The generated images greatly improved including prior regularizer prefers inputs natural image statistics without preference particular image simply smooth
For example Mahendran et al
used total variation regularizer prefers images piecewise constant
Various regularizers discussed
An depth visual exploration feature visualization regularization techniques published recently The cited resemblance imagery LSD psilocybin induced hallucinations suggestive functional resemblance artificial neural networks particular layers visual cortex
Usage The dreaming idea applied hidden internal neurons output allows exploration roles representations various parts network
It also possible optimize input satisfy either single neuron usage sometimes called Activity Maximization entire layer neurons
While dreaming often used visualizing networks producing computer art recently proposed adding dreamed inputs training set improve training times abstractions Computer Science The DeepDream model also demonstrated application field art history DeepDream used Foster People music video song Doing It Money Recently research group University Sussex created Hallucination Machine applying DeepDream algorithm pre recorded panoramic video allowing users explore virtual reality environments mimic experience psychoactive substances psychopathological conditions
They able demonstrate subjective experiences induced Hallucination Machine differed significantly control non hallucinogenic videos bearing phenomenological similarities psychedelic state following administration psilocybin

In futurology singleton hypothetical world order single decision making agency highest level capable exerting effective control domain permanently preventing internal external threats supremacy
The term first defined Nick Bostrom
Overview An artificial general intelligence undergone intelligence explosion could form singleton could world government armed mind control social surveillance technologies
A singleton need directly micromanage everything domain could allow diverse forms organization within albeit guaranteed function within strict parameters
A singleton need support civilization fact could obliterate upon coming power
A singleton necessarily need organisation government AI
It could form people accepting values goals
These people coming together would form agency broad sense term according Bostrom
A singleton potential risks potential benefits
Notably suitable singleton could solve world coordination problems would otherwise solvable opening otherwise unavailable developmental trajectories civilization
For example Ben Goertzel AGI researcher suggests humans may instead decide create AI Nanny mildly superhuman intelligence surveillance powers protect human race existential risks like nanotechnology delay development unfriendly artificial intelligences unless safety issues solved
Furthermore Bostrom suggests singleton could hold Darwinian evolutionary pressures check preventing agents interested reproduction coming dominate Yet Bostrom also regards possibility stable repressive totalitarian global regime serious existential risk
The stability singleton makes installation bad singleton especially catastrophic since consequences never undone
Bryan Caplan writes perhaps eternity totalitarianism would worse extinction Similarly Hans Morgenthau stressed mechanical development weapons transportation communication makes conquest world technically possible make technically possible keep world conquered state
Its lack reason great ancient empires though vast failed complete universal conquest world perpetuate conquest
Now however possible
Technology undoes geographic climatic barriers
Today technological obstacle stands way world wide empire modern technology makes possible extend control mind action every corner globe regardless geography season
Morgenthau continued technological progress It also given total war terrifying world embracing impetus seems satisfied nothing less world dominion The machine age begets triumphs forward step calling forth two road technological progress
It also begets victories military political ability conquer world keep conquered creates conquer

Remarks A sensor sharing application CogInfoCom brings novelty traditional infocommunications sense convey kind signal normally perceptible actor senses e without distance communicate across end communication line
The transferred information may describe actor involved communication also environment actor located
The key determinant sensor sharing communication sensory modality used perceive sensory information receiving end communication would used two actors end case would need infocommunication
Sensor bridging cases reflect way information conveyed e changing sensory modality also kind information conveyed
Whenever transferred information type imperceptible receiving actor due lack appropriate sensory modality e g cognitive system incompatible information type communication information necessarily occur sensor bridging
A CogInfoCom application regarded instance representation sharing even bridges different sensors
For example text conveyed blind person using Braille writing tactile sensory modality used instead vision representation still consists linear succession textual elements represent individual characters alphabet
By token CogInfoCom application regarded representation bridging even uses sensor sharing The first draft definition CogInfoCom given Cognitive Infocommunications CogInfoCom
The definition finalized based paper joint participation Startup Committee st International Workshop Cognitive Infocommunications held Tokyo Japan

In machine learning particularly creation artificial neural networks ensemble averaging process creating multiple models combining produce desired output opposed creating one model
Frequently ensemble models performs better individual model various errors models average
Overview Ensemble averaging one simplest types committee machines
Along boosting one two major types static committee machines
In contrast standard network design many networks generated one kept ensemble averaging keeps less satisfactory networks around less weight
The theory ensemble averaging relies two properties artificial neural networks In network bias reduced cost increased variance In group networks variance reduced cost biasEnsemble averaging creates group networks low bias high variance combines new network hopefully low bias low variance
It thus resolution bias variance dilemma
The idea combining experts traced back Pierre Simon Laplace
Method The theory mentioned gives obvious strategy create set experts low bias high variance average
Generally means create set experts varying parameters frequently initial synaptic weights although factors learning rate momentum etc
may varied well
Some authors recommend varying weight decay early stopping
The steps therefore Generate N experts initial values
Initial values usually chosen randomly distribution
Train expert separately
Combine experts average values Alternatively domain knowledge may used generate several classes experts
An expert class trained combined
A complex version ensemble average views final result mere average experts rather weighted sum
If expert displaystyle y_ overall result displaystyle tilde defined x α j p α j j x displaystyle tilde mathbf x mathbf alpha sum _ j p alpha _ j y_ j mathbf x α displaystyle mathbf alpha set weights
The optimization problem finding alpha readily solved neural networks hence meta network neuron fact entire neural network trained synaptic weights final network weight applied expert
This known linear combination experts It seen forms neural networks subset linear combination standard neural net one expert used simply linear combination α j displaystyle alpha _ j one α k displaystyle alpha _ k
A raw average α j displaystyle alpha _ j equal constant value namely one total number experts A recent ensemble averaging method negative correlation learning proposed Y Liu X Yao
Now method widely used evolutionary computing
Benefits The resulting committee almost always less complex single network would achieve level performance The resulting committee trained easily smaller input sets The resulting committee often improved performance single network The risk overfitting lessened fewer parameters weights need set See also Ensemble learning References Further reading Perrone M P Improving regression estimation Averaging methods variance reduction extensions general convex measure optimization Wolpert D H Stacked generalization Neural Networks CiteSeerX doi S Hashem S Optimal linear combinations neural networks Neural Networks doi S PMID Hashem S B Schmeiser Approximating function derivatives using MSE optimal linear combinations trained feedforward neural networks Proceedings Joint Conference Neural Networks

In artificial intelligence research situated approach builds agents designed behave effectively successfully environment
This requires designing AI bottom focussing basic perceptual motor skills required survive
The situated approach gives much lower priority abstract reasoning problem solving skills
The approach originally proposed alternative traditional approaches approaches popular
After several decades classical AI technologies started face intractable issues e g
combinatorial explosion confronted real world modeling problems
All approaches address issues focus modeling intelligences situated environment
They become known situated approach AI
Emergence concept From traditional AI Nouvelle AI During late approach known Nouvelle AI Nouvelle means new French pioneered MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Rodney Brooks
As opposed classical traditional artificial intelligence Nouvelle AI purposely avoided traditional goal modeling human level performance rather tries create systems intelligence level insects closer real world robots
But eventually least MIT new AI lead attempt humanoid AI Cog Project
From Nouvelle AI behavior based situated AI The conceptual shift introduced nouvelle AI flourished robotics area given way behavior based artificial intelligence BBAI methodology developing AI based modular decomposition intelligence
It made famous Rodney Brooks subsumption architecture one earliest attempts describe mechanism developing BBAI
It extremely popular robotics lesser extent implement intelligent virtual agents allows successful creation real time dynamic systems run complex environments
For example underlies intelligence Sony Aibo many RoboCup robot teams
Realizing fact approaches aiming building abstract intelligence rather intelligence situated given environment come known situated approach
In fact approach stems early insights Alan Turing describing need build machines equipped sense organs learn directly real world instead focusing abstract activities playing chess
Definitions Classically software entity defined simulated element able act environment internal representation outside world
An entity communicate entities behavior consequence perceptions representations interactions entities
AI loop Simulating entities virtual environment requires simulating entire process goes perception environment generally stimulus action environment
This process called AI loop technology used simulate subdivided two categories
Sensorimotor low level AI deals either perception problem perceived
animation problem actions executed
Decisional high level AI deals action selection problem appropriate action response given perception e
appropriate behavior
Traditional symbolic AI There two main approaches decisional AI
The vast majority technologies available market planning algorithms finite state machines FSA expert systems based traditional symbolic AI approach
Its main characteristics It top subdivides recursive manner given problem series sub problems supposedly easier solve
It knowledge based relies symbolic description world set rules However limits traditional AI goal build systems mimic human intelligence well known inevitably combinatorial explosion number rules occurs due complexity environment
In fact impossible predict situations encountered autonomous entity
Situated behavioral AI In order address issues another approach decisional AI also known situated behavioral AI proposed
It attempt model systems produce deductive reasoning processes rather systems behave realistically environment
The main characteristics approach following It bottom relies elementary behaviors combined implement complex behaviors
It behavior based rely symbolic description environment rather model interactions entities environment The goal situated AI model entities autonomous environment
This achieved thanks intrinsic robustness control architecture adaptation capabilities unforeseen situations
Situated agents In artificial intelligence cognitive science term situated refers agent embedded environment
The term situated commonly used refer robots researchers argue software agents also situated exist dynamic rapidly changing environment manipulate change actions sense perceive Examples might include web based agents alter data trigger processes purchases Internet virtual reality bots inhabit change virtual worlds Second Life
Being situated generally considered part embodied useful consider perspective individually
The situated perspective emphasizes intelligent behavior derives environment agent interactions
The nature interactions defined agent embodiment
Implementation principles Modular decomposition The important attribute system driven situated AI intelligence controlled set independent semi autonomous modules
In original systems module actually separate device least conceived running processing thread
Generally though modules abstractions
In respect situated AI may seen software engineering approach AI perhaps akin object oriented design
Situated AI often associated reactive planning two synonymous
Brooks advocated extreme version cognitive minimalism required initially behavior modules finite state machines thus contained conventional memory learning
This associated reactive AI reactive AI requires reacting current state world agent memory preconception world
However learning obviously key realistic strong AI constraint relaxed though entirely abandoned
Action selection mechanism The situated AI community presented several solutions modeling decision making processes also known action selection mechanisms
The first attempt solve problem goes back subsumption architectures fact implementation technique algorithm
However attempt paved way several others particular free flow hierarchies activation networks
A comparison structure performances two mechanisms demonstrated advantage using free flow hierarchies solving action selection problem
However motor schemas process description languages two approaches used success autonomous robots

In computer science specifically algorithms related pathfinding heuristic function said admissible never overestimates cost reaching goal e
cost estimates reach goal higher lowest possible cost current point path
Search algorithms An admissible heuristic used estimate cost reaching goal state informed search algorithm
In order heuristic admissible search problem estimated cost must always lower equal actual cost reaching goal state
The search algorithm uses admissible heuristic find estimated optimal path goal state current node
For example A search evaluation function n displaystyle n current node f n g n h n displaystyle f n g n h n f n displaystyle f n evaluation function
g n displaystyle g n cost start node current node h n displaystyle h n estimated cost current node goal
h n displaystyle h n calculated using heuristic function
With non admissible heuristic A algorithm could overlook optimal solution search problem due overestimation f n displaystyle f n
Formulation n displaystyle n node h displaystyle h heuristic h n displaystyle h n cost indicated h displaystyle h reach goal n displaystyle n h n displaystyle h n optimal cost reach goal n displaystyle n h n displaystyle h n admissible n displaystyle forall n h n h n displaystyle h n leq h n Construction An admissible heuristic derived relaxed version problem information pattern databases store exact solutions subproblems problem using inductive learning methods
Examples Two different examples admissible heuristics apply fifteen puzzle problem Hamming distance Manhattan distanceThe Hamming distance total number misplaced tiles
It clear heuristic admissible since total number moves order tiles correctly least number misplaced tiles tile place must moved least
The cost number moves goal ordered puzzle least Hamming distance puzzle
The Manhattan distance puzzle defined h n tiles n c e tile correct position displaystyle h n sum _ text tiles mathit distance text tile correct position Consider puzzle player wishes move tile numbers ordered
The Manhattan distance admissible heuristic case every tile moved least number spots correct position
The subscripts show Manhattan distance tile
The total Manhattan distance shown puzzle h n displaystyle h n Optimality Guarantee If admissible heuristic adapted algorithm example A search algorithm algorithm would eventually find optimal solution goal
A well known easy understand example breadth first search
In case BFS heuristic evaluation function h n displaystyle h n equals displaystyle node n displaystyle n obviously less actual cost thus underestimated
This heuristic would cause BFS algorithm search literally possible paths eventually find optimal solution e shortest path goal
As example admissibility guarantee optimality let say costs follows cost node heuristic cost edge actual cost START O GOAL O O O So clearly start visiting top middle node since expected total cost e
f n displaystyle f n displaystyle
Then goal would candidate f n displaystyle f n equal displaystyle
Then clearly pick bottom nodes one followed updated goal since f n displaystyle f n lower f n displaystyle f n current goal e
f n displaystyle f n displaystyle
So even though goal candidate pick still better paths
This way admissible heuristic ensure optimality
However note although admissible heuristic guarantee final optimality necessarily efficient
Notes While consistent heuristics admissible admissible heuristics consistent
For tree search problems admissible heuristic used A search algorithm never return suboptimal goal node

Definitions Computer science defines AI research study intelligent agents device perceives environment takes actions maximize chance successfully achieving goals
A elaborate definition characterizes AI system ability correctly interpret external data learn data use learnings achieve specific goals tasks flexible adaptation Basics A typical AI analyzes environment takes actions maximize chance success
An AI intended utility function goal simple AI wins game Go otherwise complex Do mathematically similar actions ones succeeded past
Goals explicitly defined induced
If AI programmed reinforcement learning goals implicitly induced rewarding types behavior punishing others
Alternatively evolutionary system induce goals using fitness function mutate preferentially replicate high scoring AI systems similar animals evolved innately desire certain goals finding food
Some AI systems nearest neighbor instead reason analogy systems generally given goals except degree goals implicit training data
Such systems still benchmarked non goal system framed system whose goal successfully accomplish narrow classification task AI often revolves around use algorithms
An algorithm set unambiguous instructions mechanical computer execute
A complex algorithm often built top simpler algorithms
A simple example algorithm following optimal first player recipe play tic tac toe If someone threat two row take remaining square
Otherwise move forks create two threats play move
Otherwise take center square free
Otherwise opponent played corner take opposite corner
Otherwise take empty corner one exists
Otherwise take empty square Many AI algorithms capable learning data enhance learning new heuristics strategies rules thumb worked well past write algorithms
Some learners described including Bayesian networks decision trees nearest neighbor could theoretically given infinite data time memory learn approximate function including combination mathematical functions would best describe world
These learners could therefore derive possible knowledge considering every possible hypothesis matching data
In practice almost never possible consider every possibility phenomenon combinatorial explosion amount time needed solve problem grows exponentially
Much AI research involves figuring identify avoid considering broad range possibilities unlikely beneficial
For example viewing map looking shortest driving route Denver New York East one cases skip looking path San Francisco areas far West thus AI wielding pathfinding algorithm like A avoid combinatorial explosion would ensue every possible route ponderously considered turn The earliest easiest understand approach AI symbolism formal logic If otherwise healthy adult fever may influenza
A second general approach Bayesian inference If current patient fever adjust probability influenza way
The third major approach extremely popular routine business AI applications analogizers SVM nearest neighbor After examining records known past patients whose temperature symptoms age factors mostly match current patient X patients turned influenza
A fourth approach harder intuitively understand inspired brain machinery works artificial neural network approach uses artificial neurons learn comparing desired output altering strengths connections internal neurons reinforce connections seemed useful
These four main approaches overlap evolutionary systems example neural nets learn make inferences generalize make analogies
Some systems implicitly explicitly use multiple approaches alongside many AI non AI algorithms best approach often different depending problem Learning algorithms work basis strategies algorithms inferences worked well past likely continue working well future
These inferences obvious since sun rose every morning last days probably rise tomorrow morning well
They nuanced X families geographically separate species color variants Y chance undiscovered black swans exist
Learners also work basis Occam razor The simplest theory explains data likeliest
Therefore according Occam razor principle learner must designed prefers simpler theories complex theories except cases complex theory proven substantially better
Settling bad overly complex theory gerrymandered fit past training data known overfitting
Many systems attempt reduce overfitting rewarding theory accordance well fits data penalizing theory accordance complex theory
Besides classic overfitting learners also disappoint learning wrong lesson
A toy example image classifier trained pictures brown horses black cats might conclude brown patches likely horses
A real world example unlike humans current image classifiers determine spatial relationship components picture instead learn abstract patterns pixels humans oblivious linearly correlate images certain types real objects
Faintly superimposing pattern legitimate image results adversarial image system misclassifies
Compared humans existing AI lacks several features human commonsense reasoning notably humans powerful mechanisms reasoning naïve physics space time physical interactions
This enables even young children easily make inferences like If I roll pen table fall floor
Humans also powerful mechanism folk psychology helps interpret natural language sentences The city councilmen refused demonstrators permit advocated violence
A generic AI difficulty discerning whether ones alleged advocating violence councilmen demonstrators
This lack common knowledge means AI often makes different mistakes humans make ways seem incomprehensible

Challenges The cognitive capabilities current architectures limited using simplified version intelligence really capable

Sub symbolic By progress symbolic AI seemed stall many believed symbolic systems would never able imitate processes human cognition especially perception robotics learning pattern recognition
A number researchers began look sub symbolic approaches specific AI problems
Sub symbolic methods manage approach intelligence without specific representations knowledge
Embodied intelligence This includes embodied situated behavior based nouvelle AI
Researchers related field robotics Rodney Brooks rejected symbolic AI focused basic engineering problems would allow robots move survive
Their work revived non symbolic point view early cybernetics researchers reintroduced use control theory AI
This coincided development embodied mind thesis related field cognitive science idea aspects body movement perception visualization required higher intelligence
Within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches elaborated upon allow robots accumulate repertoires novel skills autonomous self exploration social interaction human teachers use guidance mechanisms active learning maturation motor synergies etc
Computational intelligence soft computing Interest neural networks connectionism revived David Rumelhart others middle
Artificial neural networks example soft computing solutions problems cannot solved complete logical certainty approximate solution often sufficient
Other soft computing approaches AI include fuzzy systems Grey system theory evolutionary computation many statistical tools
The application soft computing AI studied collectively emerging discipline computational intelligence
Statistical learning Much traditional GOFAI got bogged ad hoc patches symbolic computation worked toy models failed generalize real world results
However around AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools hidden Markov models HMM information theory normative Bayesian decision theory compare unify competing architectures
The shared mathematical language permitted high level collaboration established fields like mathematics economics operations research
Compared GOFAI new statistical learning techniques HMM neural networks gaining higher levels accuracy many practical domains data mining without necessarily acquiring semantic understanding datasets
The increased successes real world data led increasing emphasis comparing different approaches shared test data see approach performed best broader context provided idiosyncratic toy models AI research becoming scientific
Nowadays results experiments often rigorously measurable sometimes difficulty reproducible
Different statistical learning techniques different limitations example basic HMM cannot model infinite possible combinations natural language
Critics note shift GOFAI statistical learning often also shift away explainable AI
In AGI research scholars caution reliance statistical learning argue continuing research GOFAI still necessary attain general intelligence
Integrating approaches Intelligent agent paradigm An intelligent agent system perceives environment takes actions maximize chances success
The simplest intelligent agents programs solve specific problems
More complicated agents include human beings organizations human beings firms
The paradigm allows researchers directly compare even combine different approaches isolated problems asking agent best maximizing given goal function
An agent solves specific problem use approach works agents symbolic logical sub symbolic artificial neural networks others may use new approaches
The paradigm also gives researchers common language communicate fields decision theory economics also use concepts abstract agents
Building complete agent requires researchers address realistic problems integration example sensory systems give uncertain information environment planning systems must able function presence uncertainty
The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted Agent architectures cognitive architectures Researchers designed systems build intelligent systems interacting intelligent agents multi agent system
A hierarchical control system provides bridge sub symbolic AI lowest reactive levels traditional symbolic AI highest levels relaxed time constraints permit planning world modeling
Some cognitive architectures custom built solve narrow problem others Soar designed mimic human cognition provide insight general intelligence
Modern extensions Soar hybrid intelligent systems include symbolic sub symbolic components
Tools AI developed many tools solve difficult problems computer science
A general methods discussed
Search optimization Many problems AI solved theory intelligently searching many possible solutions Reasoning reduced performing search
For example logical proof viewed searching path leads premises conclusions step application inference rule
Planning algorithms search trees goals subgoals attempting find path target goal process called means ends analysis
Robotics algorithms moving limbs grasping objects use local searches configuration space
Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based optimization
Simple exhaustive searches rarely sufficient real world problems search space number places search quickly grows astronomical numbers
The result search slow never completes
The solution many problems use heuristics rules thumb prioritize choices favor likely reach goal shorter number steps
In search methodologies heuristics also serve entirely eliminate choices unlikely lead goal called pruning search tree
Heuristics supply program best guess path solution lies
Heuristics limit search solutions smaller sample size A different kind search came prominence based mathematical theory optimization
For many problems possible begin search form guess refine guess incrementally refinements made
These algorithms visualized blind hill climbing begin search random point landscape jumps steps keep moving guess uphill reach top
Other optimization algorithms simulated annealing beam search random optimization
Evolutionary computation uses form optimization search
For example may begin population organisms guesses allow mutate recombine selecting fittest survive generation refining guesses
Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms gene expression programming genetic programming
Alternatively distributed search processes coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms
Two popular swarm algorithms used search particle swarm optimization inspired bird flocking ant colony optimization inspired ant trails
Logic Logic used knowledge representation problem solving applied problems well
For example satplan algorithm uses logic planning inductive logic programming method learning Several different forms logic used AI research
Propositional logic involves truth functions
First order logic adds quantifiers predicates express facts objects properties relations
Fuzzy set theory assigns degree truth vague statements Alice old rich tall hungry linguistically imprecise completely true false
Fuzzy logic successfully used control systems allow experts contribute vague rules close destination station moving fast increase train brake pressure vague rules numerically refined within system
Fuzzy logic fails scale well knowledge bases many AI researchers question validity chaining fuzzy logic inferences Default logics non monotonic logics circumscription forms logic designed help default reasoning qualification problem
Several extensions logic designed handle specific domains knowledge description logics situation calculus event calculus fluent calculus representing events time causal calculus belief calculus belief revision modal logics
Logics model contradictory inconsistent statements arising multi agent systems also designed paraconsistent logics
Probabilistic methods uncertain reasoning Many problems AI reasoning planning learning perception robotics require agent operate incomplete uncertain information
AI researchers devised number powerful tools solve problems using methods probability theory economics Bayesian networks general tool used various problems reasoning using Bayesian inference algorithm learning using expectation maximization algorithm planning using decision networks perception using dynamic Bayesian networks
Probabilistic algorithms also used filtering prediction smoothing finding explanations streams data helping perception systems analyze processes occur time e g hidden Markov models Kalman filters
Compared symbolic logic formal Bayesian inference computationally expensive
For inference tractable observations must conditionally independent one another
Complicated graphs diamonds loops undirected cycles require sophisticated method Markov chain Monte Carlo spreads ensemble random walkers throughout Bayesian network attempts converge assessment conditional probabilities
Bayesian networks used Xbox Live rate match players wins losses evidence good player
AdSense uses Bayesian network million edges learn ads serve A key concept science economics utility measure valuable something intelligent agent
Precise mathematical tools developed analyze agent make choices plan using decision theory decision analysis information value theory
These tools include models Markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory mechanism design
Classifiers statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications divided two types classifiers shiny diamond controllers shiny pick
Controllers however also classify conditions inferring actions therefore classification forms central part many AI systems
Classifiers functions use pattern matching determine closest match
They tuned according examples making attractive use AI
These examples known observations patterns
In supervised learning pattern belongs certain predefined class
A class seen decision made
All observations combined class labels known data set
When new observation received observation classified based previous experience A classifier trained various ways many statistical machine learning approaches
The decision tree perhaps widely used machine learning algorithm
Other widely used classifiers neural network k nearest neighbor algorithm kernel methods support vector machine SVM Gaussian mixture model extremely popular naive Bayes classifier
Classifier performance depends greatly characteristics data classified dataset size distribution samples across classes dimensionality level noise
Model based classifiers perform well assumed model extremely good fit actual data
Otherwise matching model available accuracy rather speed scalability sole concern conventional wisdom discriminative classifiers especially SVM tend accurate model based classifiers naive Bayes practical data sets

Philosophy ethics There three philosophical questions related AI Is artificial general intelligence possible
Can machine solve problem human solve using intelligence
Or hard limits machine accomplish
Are intelligent machines dangerous
How ensure machines behave ethically used ethically
Can machine mind consciousness mental states exactly sense human beings
Can machine sentient thus deserve certain rights
Can machine intentionally cause harm
The limits artificial general intelligence Can machine intelligent
Can think
Alan Turing polite convention We need decide machine think need decide machine act intelligently human
This approach philosophical problems associated artificial intelligence forms basis Turing test The Dartmouth proposal Every aspect learning feature intelligence precisely described machine made simulate
This conjecture printed proposal Dartmouth Conference Newell Simon physical symbol system hypothesis A physical symbol system necessary sufficient means general intelligent action
Newell Simon argue intelligence consists formal operations symbols
Hubert Dreyfus argued contrary human expertise depends unconscious instinct rather conscious symbol manipulation feel situation rather explicit symbolic knowledge
See Dreyfus critique AI
Gödelian arguments Gödel John Lucas Roger Penrose detailed argument onwards made highly technical arguments human mathematicians consistently see truth Gödel statements therefore computational abilities beyond mechanical Turing machines
However people agree Gödelian arguments The artificial brain argument The brain simulated machines brains intelligent simulated brains must also intelligent thus machines intelligent
Hans Moravec Ray Kurzweil others argued technologically feasible copy brain directly hardware software simulation essentially identical original The AI effect Machines already intelligent observers failed recognize
When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov chess machine acting intelligently
However onlookers commonly discount behavior artificial intelligence program arguing real intelligence thus real intelligence whatever intelligent behavior people machines still cannot
This known AI Effect AI whatever done yet
Potential harm Widespread use artificial intelligence could unintended consequences dangerous undesirable
Scientists Future Life Institute among others described short term research goals see AI influences economy laws ethics involved AI minimize AI security risks
In long term scientists proposed continue optimizing function minimizing possible security risks come along new technologies The potential negative effects AI automation major issue Andrew Yang presidential campaign
Irakli Beridze Head Centre Artificial Intelligence Robotics UNICRI United Nations expressed I think dangerous applications AI point view would criminals large terrorist organizations using disrupt large processes simply pure harm
Terrorists could cause harm via digital warfare could combination robotics drones AI things well could really dangerous
And course risks come things like job losses
If massive numbers people losing jobs find solution extremely dangerous
Things like lethal autonomous weapons systems properly governed otherwise massive potential misuse
Existential risk Physicist Stephen Hawking Microsoft founder Bill Gates SpaceX founder Elon Musk expressed concerns possibility AI could evolve point humans could control Hawking theorizing could spell end human race
The development full artificial intelligence could spell end human race
Once humans develop artificial intelligence take redesign ever increasing rate
Humans limited slow biological evolution compete would superseded
In book Superintelligence philosopher Nick Bostrom provides argument artificial intelligence pose threat humankind
He argues sufficiently intelligent AI chooses actions based achieving goal exhibit convergent behavior acquiring resources protecting shut
If AI goals fully reflect humanity one example AI told compute many digits pi possible might harm humanity order acquire resources prevent shut ultimately better achieve goal
Bostrom also emphasizes difficulty fully conveying humanity values advanced AI
He uses hypothetical example giving AI goal make humans smile illustrate misguided attempt
If AI scenario become superintelligent Bostrom argues may resort methods humans would find horrifying inserting electrodes facial muscles humans cause constant beaming grins would efficient way achieve goal making humans smile
In book Human Compatible AI researcher Stuart J Russell echoes Bostrom concerns also proposing approach developing provably beneficial machines focused uncertainty deference humans possibly involving inverse reinforcement learning Concern risk artificial intelligence led high profile donations investments
A group prominent tech titans including Peter Thiel Amazon Web Services Musk committed billion OpenAI nonprofit company aimed championing responsible AI development
The opinion experts within field artificial intelligence mixed sizable fractions concerned unconcerned risk eventual superhumanly capable AI
Other technology industry leaders believe artificial intelligence helpful current form continue assist humans
Oracle CEO Mark Hurd stated AI actually create jobs less jobs humans needed manage AI systems
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes AI unlock huge amount positive things curing disease increasing safety autonomous cars
In January Musk donated million Future Life Institute fund research understanding AI decision making
The goal institute grow wisdom manage growing power technology
Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence DeepMind Vicarious keep eye going artificial intelligence
I think potentially dangerous outcome
For danger uncontrolled advanced AI realized hypothetical AI would overpower think humanity minority experts argue possibility far enough future worth researching
Other counterarguments revolve around humans either intrinsically convergently valuable perspective artificial intelligence
Devaluation humanity Joseph Weizenbaum wrote AI applications cannot definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy use AI technology fields customer service psychotherapy deeply misguided
Weizenbaum also bothered AI researchers philosophers willing view human mind nothing computer program position known computationalism
To Weizenbaum points suggest AI research devalues human life
Social justice One concern AI programs may programmed biased certain groups women minorities developers wealthy Caucasian men
Support artificial intelligence higher among men approving women approving
Algorithms host applications today legal system already assisting officials ranging judges parole officers public defenders gauging predicted likelihood recidivism defendants
COMPAS acronym Correctional Offender Management Profiling Alternative Sanctions counts among widely utilized commercially available solutions
It suggested COMPAS assigns exceptionally elevated risk recidivism black defendants conversely ascribing low risk estimate white defendants significantly often statistically expected
Decrease demand human labor The relationship automation employment complicated
While automation eliminates old jobs also creates new jobs micro economic macro economic effects
Unlike previous waves automation many middle class jobs may eliminated artificial intelligence The Economist states worry AI could white collar jobs steam power blue collar ones Industrial Revolution worth taking seriously
Subjective estimates risk vary widely example Michael Osborne Carl Benedikt Frey estimate U S jobs high risk potential automation OECD report classifies U S jobs high risk
Jobs extreme risk range paralegals fast food cooks job demand likely increase care related professions ranging personal healthcare clergy
Author Martin Ford others go argue many jobs routine repetitive AI predictable Ford warns jobs may automated next couple decades many new jobs may accessible people average capability even retraining
Economists point past technology tended increase rather reduce total employment acknowledge uncharted territory AI
Autonomous weapons Currently countries researching battlefield robots including United States China Russia United Kingdom
Many people concerned risk superintelligent AI also want limit use artificial soldiers drones
Ethical machines Machines intelligence potential use intelligence prevent harm minimize risks may ability use ethical reasoning better choose actions world
Research area includes machine ethics artificial moral agents friendly AI discussion towards building human rights framework also talks
Artificial moral agents Wendell Wallach introduced concept artificial moral agents AMA book Moral Machines For Wallach AMAs become part research landscape artificial intelligence guided two central questions identifies Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions Can Ro bots Really Be Moral
For Wallach question centered issue whether machines demonstrate equivalent moral behavior contrast constraints society may place development AMAs
Machine ethics The field machine ethics concerned giving machines ethical principles procedure discovering way resolve ethical dilemmas might encounter enabling function ethically responsible manner ethical decision making
The field delineated AAAI Fall Symposium Machine Ethics Past research concerning relationship technology ethics largely focused responsible irresponsible use technology human beings people interested human beings ought treat machines
In cases human beings engaged ethical reasoning
The time come adding ethical dimension least machines
Recognition ethical ramifications behavior involving machines well recent potential developments machine autonomy necessitate
In contrast computer hacking software property issues privacy issues topics normally ascribed computer ethics machine ethics concerned behavior machines towards human users machines
Research machine ethics key alleviating concerns autonomous systems could argued notion autonomous machines without dimension root fear concerning machine intelligence
Further investigation machine ethics could enable discovery problems current ethical theories advancing thinking Ethics
Machine ethics sometimes referred machine morality computational ethics computational morality
A variety perspectives nascent field found collected edition Machine Ethics stems AAAI Fall Symposium Machine Ethics
Malevolent friendly AI Political scientist Charles T Rubin believes AI neither designed guaranteed benevolent
He argues sufficiently advanced benevolence may indistinguishable malevolence
Humans assume machines robots would treat us favorably priori reason believe would sympathetic system morality evolved along particular biology AIs would share
Hyper intelligent software may necessarily decide support continued existence humanity would extremely difficult stop
This topic also recently begun discussed academic publications real source risks civilization humans planet Earth
One proposal deal ensure first generally intelligent AI Friendly AI able control subsequently developed AIs
Some question whether kind check could actually remain place
Leading AI researcher Rodney Brooks writes I think mistake worrying us developing malevolent AI anytime next hundred years
I think worry stems fundamental error distinguishing difference real recent advances particular aspect AI enormity complexity building sentient volitional intelligence
Machine consciousness sentience mind If AI system replicates key aspects human intelligence system also sentient mind conscious experiences
This question closely related philosophical problem nature human consciousness generally referred hard problem consciousness
Consciousness David Chalmers identified two problems understanding mind named hard easy problems consciousness
The easy problem understanding brain processes signals makes plans controls behavior
The hard problem explaining feels feel like anything
Human information processing easy explain however human subjective experience difficult explain
For example consider happens person shown color swatch identifies saying red
The easy problem requires understanding machinery brain makes possible person know color swatch red
The hard problem people also know something else also know red looks like
Consider person born blind know something red without knowing red looks like
Everyone knows subjective experience exists every day e g sighted people know red looks like
The hard problem explaining brain creates exists different knowledge aspects brain
Computationalism functionalism Computationalism position philosophy mind human mind human brain information processing system thinking form computing
Computationalism argues relationship mind body similar identical relationship software hardware thus may solution mind body problem
This philosophical position inspired work AI researchers cognitive scientists originally proposed philosophers Jerry Fodor Hilary Putnam
Strong AI hypothesis The philosophical position John Searle named strong AI states The appropriately programmed computer right inputs outputs would thereby mind exactly sense human beings minds
Searle counters assertion Chinese room argument asks us look inside computer try find mind might
Robot rights If machine created intelligence could also feel
If feel rights human
This issue known robot rights currently considered example California Institute Future although many critics believe discussion premature
Some critics transhumanism argue hypothetical robot rights would lie spectrum animal rights human rights
The subject profoundly discussed documentary film Plug Pray many sci fi media Star Trek Next Generation character Commander Data fought disassembled research wanted become human robotic holograms Voyager
Superintelligence Are limits intelligent machines human machine hybrids
A superintelligence hyperintelligence superhuman intelligence hypothetical agent would possess intelligence far surpassing brightest gifted human mind
Superintelligence may also refer form degree intelligence possessed agent
Technological singularity If research Strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software might able reprogram improve
The improved software would even better improving leading recursive self improvement
The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially dramatically surpass humans
Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named scenario singularity
Technological singularity accelerating progress technologies cause runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence exceed human intellectual capacity control thus radically changing even ending civilization
Because capabilities intelligence may impossible comprehend technological singularity occurrence beyond events unpredictable even unfathomable Ray Kurzweil used Moore law describes relentless exponential improvement digital technology calculate desktop computers processing power human brains year predicts singularity occur
Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec cyberneticist Kevin Warwick inventor Ray Kurzweil predicted humans machines merge future cyborgs capable powerful either
This idea called transhumanism roots Aldous Huxley Robert Ettinger
Edward Fredkin argues artificial intelligence next stage evolution idea first proposed Samuel Butler Darwin among Machines far back expanded upon George Dyson book name
Economics The long term economic effects AI uncertain
A survey economists showed disagreement whether increasing use robots AI cause substantial increase long term unemployment generally agree could net benefit productivity gains redistributed
In fiction Thought capable artificial beings appeared storytelling devices since antiquity persistent theme science fiction
A common trope works began Mary Shelley Frankenstein human creation becomes threat masters
This includes works Arthur C Clarke Stanley Kubrick A Space Odyssey HAL murderous computer charge Discovery One spaceship well The Terminator The Matrix
In contrast rare loyal robots Gort The Day Earth Stood Still Bishop Aliens less prominent popular culture Isaac Asimov introduced Three Laws Robotics many books stories notably Multivac series super intelligent computer name
Asimov laws often brought lay discussions machine ethics almost artificial intelligence researchers familiar Asimov laws popular culture generally consider laws useless many reasons one ambiguity Transhumanism merging humans machines explored manga Ghost Shell science fiction series Dune
In artist Hajime Sorayama Sexy Robots series painted published Japan depicting actual organic human form lifelike muscular metallic skins later Gynoids book followed used influenced movie makers including George Lucas creatives
Sorayama never considered organic robots real part nature always unnatural product human mind fantasy existing mind even realized actual form
Several works use AI force us confront fundamental question makes us human showing us artificial beings ability feel thus suffer
This appears Karel Čapek R U R films A I
Artificial Intelligence Ex Machina well novel Do Androids Dream Electric Sheep Philip K Dick

Chinese speech synthesis application speech synthesis Chinese language usually Standard Chinese
It poses additional difficulties due Chinese characters frequently different pronunciations different contexts complex prosody essential convey meaning words sometimes difficulty obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning correct pronunciation certain phonemes
Concatenation Ekho KeyTip Recordings concatenated desired combination joins sound forced usual simple concatenation based speech synthesis severely affect prosody synthesizers also inflexible terms speed expression
However synthesizers rely corpus noticeable degradation performance given unusual awkward phrases
Ekho open source TTS simply concatenates sampled syllables
It currently supports Cantonese Mandarin experimentally Korean
Some Mandarin syllables pitched normalised Praat
A modified version used Gradint synthesis partials

An Internet Protocol camera IP camera type digital video camera receives control data sends image data via Internet
They commonly used surveillance
Unlike analog closed circuit television CCTV cameras require local recording device local area network
Most IP cameras webcams term IP camera netcam usually applies used surveillance directly accessed network connection
Some IP cameras require support central network video recorder NVR handle recording video alarm management
Others able operate decentralized manner NVR needed camera able record directly local remote storage media
The first centralized IP camera Axis Neteye released Axis Communications
History The first centralized IP camera Axis Neteye released Axis Communications developed team Martin Gren Carl Axel Alm
Though promoted based direct accessibility anywhere internet connection camera stream real time motion video limited snapshot image time camera accessed
At time launch considered incapable operating motion camera due time enormous bandwidth requirements
Thus aimed primarily tourism industry
The Axis Neteye intended replace traditional analogue CCTV systems given capability limited one frame per second CIF one every seconds CIF resolution maximum resolution quality MP x
Axis used custom proprietary web server named OSYS yet summer started porting camera software Linux
Axis also released documentation low level application programming interface API called VAPIX builds open standards HTTP real time streaming protocol RTSP
This open architecture intended encourage third party software manufacturers develop compatible management recording software
The first decentralized IP camera released Mobotix
The camera Linux system contained video alarm recording management functions
The first IP camera onboard video content analytics VCA released Intellio
This camera able detect number different events object stolen human crossed line human entered predefined zone car moved wrong direction
Standards Previous generations analog CCTV cameras use established broadcast television formats e g
Common Intermediate Format CIF NTSC PAL SECAM
Since shift consumer TV business towards high definition HD resolutions e g
P Full HD K resolution Ultra HD widescreen format
IP cameras may differ one another resolution features video encoding schemes available network protocols API video management software
IP cameras available resolutions VGA resolution megapixels To address IP video surveillance standardization issues two industry groups formed Open Network Video Interface Forum ONVIF Physical Security Interoperability Alliance PSIA
PSIA founded member companies including Honeywell GE Security Cisco
ONVIF founded Axis Communications Bosch Sony
Each group numerous additional members thus cameras recording hardware operate standard work
WIFI Home Camera Most consumer level IP cameras used home security send live video stream companion app users phone
IP cameras home generally connect internet WiFi Broadband Ethernet cable IP cameras used common small businesses homes changing
A survey Americans revealed owned home security cameras This crossover IP cameras comes device self installation
IP cameras require professional installation saving time home business owners
Whereas large businesses commercial spaces like malls require high resolution videos e K many cameras professional applications accommodate type needs
One popular applications WIFI home security cameras ability view camera footage via mobile app installed mobile device
Many cameras offer features wide angle lens around degrees pan tilt degrees horizontal degrees vertical low light night vision motion detection
When event occurs detected motion users receive alarms via app
Video clips stored local device micro SD cloud service The market size home security systems reached billion dollars
This displayed CAGR
Countries Uganda Sweden Italy Tanzania suffer high crime rates particularly robbery theft keen adopt home security cameras
In addition two countries US China high implementation rate residential security cameras Major key players home security market Nest owned Google US Ring owned Amazon US Arlo owned Netgear US SimpliSafe US
Hikvision Digital Technology Ltd Leshi Video Tech China largest camera manufacturers
As alarm security industry key players ADT Inc Security Services US Vivint Inc Frontpoint Security Solutions
IP camera types Indoor camera Indoor camera widely used residential commercial retail office space
Depending price points functionality fixed camera Ptz camera
Fixed camera utilized monitor unobtrusive area PTZ camera either track motion manually adjust monitoring area
Outdoor wired AC powered camera Like name suggests outdoor camera placed outdoor environment sustain weather conditions heat cold rain moisture
The IP IP rated common standards withstand outdoor circumstances
Outdoor camera also capable capturing videos low light conditions
Wired AC Powered Wired free cameras homes Wired AC power WIFI cameras provides reliable power source stable signal
However highly desirable accessible place power outlets roof instance
Wired free camera contrary uses WIFI connection power sources like solar battery power cord
There hassle wiring drilling area easily accessed roof top garage door
Wirefree cameras offer convenience free hiring contractor wire cables
However without trade offs
There need change battery frequently important video footage may missed due lack power
There one risk cameras may undesirably removed since fully secured wire
Cloud storage stay local
Some camera manufacturers offered cloud subscriptions users may view download video clips certain number days looping paying recurring subscription fees
Cloud stored videos accessed remotely
Cloud subscription plan typically comes number days looping ie days videos overwritten beyond duration
Some cameras include micro SD card slot users may store videos locally
There looping long memory card sufficient space store images
However locally stored video footage accessed remotely
Considerations Potential benefits Previous generation cameras transmitted analog video signals
IP cameras send images digitally using transmission security features TCP IP protocol
Advantages approach include Two way audio via single network cable allows users listen speak subject video e g clerk assisting customer step step instructions Use Wi Fi wireless network Distributed artificial intelligence DAI camera contain video analytics analyze images Secure data transmission encryption authentication methods WPA WPA TKIP AES Remote accessibility lets users view live video device sufficient access privileges Power Ethernet PoE supply power Ethernet cable operate without dedicated power supply Better image Resolution typically four times resolution analog camera Artificial intelligence Internet privacy The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU expressed privacy concerns AI widely practiced
AI capable tracking movements studying behaviors moreover AI may learn emotions predict movement patterns
This caused threat lives monitored computer watchers
Facial recognition system Facial recognition identifies human face analyzing facial features picture video example biometrics
If camera allows users set database includes family members close friends system may distinguish whether someone exists database
If camera capable providing accurate facial recognition tell person detects authorized database
The detection unauthorized persons may prompt owner call law enforcement
The captured videos used means catching offending person
Potential concerns Concerns include Privacy portrait rights infringement Average higher purchase cost per camera Security compromised insecure credentials given camera accessed independently video recorder Public internet connection video complicated set may require either Static IP Address Dynamic DNS though IP cameras include built dynamic DNS using peer peer P P network
Data storage concern IP Cameras requiring large hard drives
Hacking As CCTV DVR system video transmitted public internet rather private network intranet system potentially becomes open wider audience including hackers
Criminals hack CCTV system disable manipulate observe security measures personnel thereby facilitating criminal acts rendering surveillance counterproductive
This counteracted ensuring network device secured staying informed date security methods
In users chan hacked thousands streaming personal IP cameras exploiting vulnerability models Trendnet home security cameras
In reported site indexed locations worldwide security cameras unprotected using default usernames passwords

The expression computational intelligence CI usually refers ability computer learn specific task data experimental observation
Even though commonly considered synonym soft computing still commonly accepted definition computational intelligence
Generally computational intelligence set nature inspired computational methodologies approaches address complex real world problems mathematical traditional modelling useless reasons processes might complex mathematical reasoning might contain uncertainties process process might simply stochastic nature
Indeed many real life problems cannot translated binary language unique values computers process
Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions problems
The methods used close human way reasoning e
uses inexact incomplete knowledge able produce control actions adaptive way
CI therefore uses combination five main complementary techniques
The fuzzy logic enables computer understand natural language artificial neural networks permits system learn experiential data operating like biological one evolutionary computing based process natural selection learning theory probabilistic methods helps dealing uncertainty imprecision Except main principles currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms swarm intelligence artificial immune systems seen part evolutionary computation image processing data mining natural language processing artificial intelligence tends confused Computational Intelligence
But although Computational Intelligence CI Artificial Intelligence AI seek similar goals clear distinction
Computational Intelligence thus way performing like human beings
Indeed characteristic intelligence usually attributed humans
More recently many products items also claim intelligent attribute directly linked reasoning decision making
History The notion Computational Intelligence first used IEEE Neural Networks Council

HIV Resistance Response Database Initiative RDI profit organisation established following mission To improve clinical management HIV infection developing large clinical database bioinformatic techniques predict accurately individual response combination HIV drugs
The RDI following specific goals To independent repository HIV resistance treatment outcome data To use bioinformatics explore relationships resistance clinical laboratory factors HIV treatment outcome To develop make freely available system predict treatment response aid optimising individualising clinical management HIV infectionThe RDI consists small executive group based UK international advisory group leading HIV AIDS scientists clinicians extensive global network collaborators data contributors
Background Human immunodeficiency virus HIV virus causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS condition immune system begins fail leading life threatening opportunistic infections
There approximately HIV antiretroviral drugs approved treatment HIV infection six different classes based point HIV life cycle act
They used combination typically drugs different classes form therapy known highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART
The aim therapy suppression virus low ideally undetectable levels blood prevents virus depleting immune cells preferentially attacks CD cells prevents delays illness death
Despite expanding availability drugs impact use treatments continue fail often involving development resistance
During drug therapy low level virus replication still occurs particularly patient misses dose
HIV makes errors copying genetic material mutation makes virus resistant one drugs may begin replicate successfully presence drug undermine effect treatment
If happens treatment needs changed establish control virus
In well resourced healthcare settings treatment fails resistance test may run predict drugs patient virus resistant
The type test common use genotype test detects mutations viral genetic code
This information typically interpreted using rules equating individual mutations resistance individual drugs
However many different interpretation systems available always agree systems provide categorical results resistant sensitive intermediate necessarily relate well patient respond combination drugs clinic
RDI Overview The RDI established pioneer new approach develop computational models using wide range laboratory clinical data collected thousands patients treated HAART world use models predict individual patient respond different combinations drugs
Key success approach collection large amounts data train models use data wide heterogeneous range sources possible maximise generalisability models predictions
In order achieve RDI set involve many clinics worldwide possible single repository data required attempt avoid unnecessary duplication effort competition
As January RDI collected data approximately patients dozens clinics countries
It probably largest database kind world
The data includes demographic information patient multiple determinations amount virus patient bloodstream CD cells counts white blood cell critical function immune system HIV targets destroys genetic code patients virus details drugs used treat patient
The RDI used data conduct extensive research order develop accurate system possible prediction treatment response
This research involved development comparison different computational modelling methods including artificial neural networks support vector machines random forests logistical regression The predictions RDI models historically correlated well actual changes virus load patients clinic typically achieving correlation co efficient Recent models predicted whether combination treatment reduce level virus patient bloodstream undetectable levels accuracy approximately significantly better using genotype rules based interpretation
HIV TRePS In October following clinical testing two multinational studies RDI made experimental HIV Treatment Response Prediction System HIV TRePS available Internet
In January two clinical studies published indicating use HIV TRePS system could lead clinical economic benefits
The studies conducted expert HIV physicians US Canada Italy showed use system associated changes treatment decision combinations involving fewer drugs overall predicted result better virological responses suggesting use system could potentially improve patient outcomes reduce overall number cost drugs used
As clinics resource limited settings often unable afford genotyping RDI developed models predict treatment response without need genotype small loss accuracy
In July RDI made models available part HIV TRePS system
This version aimed particularly resource limited settings genotyping often routinely available
The recent models trained largest dataset far achieved accuracy comparable models use genotype predictions significantly accurate genotyping rules based interpretation HIV TRePS use approximately countries tool predict virological response therapy avoid treatment failure
The system expanded enable physicians include local drug costs modelling
A recent study data Indian cohort demonstrated system able identify combinations three locally available drugs higher probability success regimen prescribed clinic including cases treatment used clinic failed
Moreover cases alternatives less costly regimen used clinic suggesting system could help avoid treatment failure also reduce costs

Bio inspired computing begins set simple rules simple organisms adhere rules
Over time organisms evolve within simple constraints
This method could considered bottom decentralized
In traditional artificial intelligence intelligence often programmed programmer creator makes something imbues intelligence
Virtual Insect Example Bio inspired computing used train virtual insect
The insect trained navigate unknown terrain finding food equipped six simple rules turn right target obstacle left turn left target obstacle right turn left target left obstacle right turn right target right obstacle left turn left target left without obstacle turn right target right without obstacle The virtual insect controlled trained spiking neural network find food training unknown terrain
After several generations rule application usually case forms complex behaviour arise
Complexity gets built upon complexity end result something markedly complex quite often completely counterintuitive original rules would expected produce see complex systems
For reason neural network models necessary accurately model vivo network live collection noise coefficients used refine statistical inference extrapolation system complexity increases Natural evolution good analogy method rules evolution selection recombination reproduction mutation recently transposition principle simple rules yet millions years produced remarkably complex organisms

In information technology reasoning system software system generates conclusions available knowledge using logical techniques deduction induction
Reasoning systems play important role implementation artificial intelligence knowledge based systems
By everyday usage definition phrase computer systems reasoning systems automate type logic decision
In typical use Information Technology field however phrase usually reserved systems perform complex kinds reasoning
For example systems fairly straightforward types reasoning calculating sales tax customer discount making logical inferences medical diagnosis mathematical theorem
Reasoning systems come two modes interactive batch processing
Interactive systems interface user ask clarifying questions otherwise allow user guide reasoning process
Batch systems take available information generate best answer possible without user feedback guidance Reasoning systems wide field application includes scheduling business rule processing problem solving complex event processing intrusion detection predictive analytics robotics computer vision natural language processing
History The first reasoning systems theorem provers systems represent axioms statements First Order Logic use rules logic modus ponens infer new statements
Another early type reasoning system general problem solvers
These systems General Problem Solver designed Newell Simon
General problem solvers attempted provide generic planning engine could represent solve structured problems
They worked decomposing problems smaller manageable sub problems solving sub problem assembling partial answers one final answer
Another example general problem solver SOAR family systems
In practice theorem provers general problem solvers seldom useful practical applications required specialized users knowledge logic utilize
The first practical application automated reasoning expert systems
Expert systems focused much well defined domains general problem solving medical diagnosis analyzing faults aircraft
Expert systems also focused limited implementations logic
Rather attempting implement full range logical expressions typically focused modus ponens implemented via IF THEN rules
Focusing specific domain allowing restricted subset logic improved performance systems practical use real world merely research demonstrations previous automated reasoning systems
The engine used automated reasoning expert systems typically called inference engines
Those used general logical inferencing typically called theorem provers With rise popularity expert systems many new types automated reasoning applied diverse problems government industry
Some case based reasoning shoots expert systems research
Others constraint satisfaction algorithms also influenced fields decision technology linear programming
Also completely different approach one based symbolic reasoning connectionist model also extremely productive
This latter type automated reasoning especially well suited pattern matching signal detection types problems text searching face matching
Use logic The term reasoning system used apply kind sophisticated decision support system illustrated specific areas described
However common use term reasoning system implies computer representation logic
Various implementations demonstrate significant variation terms systems logic formality
Most reasoning systems implement variations propositional symbolic predicate logic
These variations may mathematically precise representations formal logic systems e g FOL extended hybrid versions systems e g Courteous logic
Reasoning systems may explicitly implement additional logic types e g modal deontic temporal logics
However many reasoning systems implement imprecise semi formal approximations recognised logic systems
These systems typically support variety procedural semi declarative techniques order model different reasoning strategies
They emphasise pragmatism formality may depend custom extensions attachments order solve real world problems
Many reasoning systems employ deductive reasoning draw inferences available knowledge
These inference engines support forward reasoning backward reasoning infer conclusions via modus ponens
The recursive reasoning methods employ termed forward chaining backward chaining respectively
Although reasoning systems widely support deductive inference systems employ abductive inductive defeasible types reasoning
Heuristics may also employed determine acceptable solutions intractable problems
Reasoning systems may employ closed world assumption CWA open world assumption OWA
The OWA often associated ontological knowledge representation Semantic Web
Different systems exhibit variety approaches negation
As well logical bitwise complement systems may support existential forms strong weak negation including negation failure inflationary negation negation non ground atoms
Different reasoning systems may support monotonic non monotonic reasoning stratification logical techniques
Reasoning uncertainty Many reasoning systems provide capabilities reasoning uncertainty
This important building situated reasoning agents must deal uncertain representations world
There several common approaches handling uncertainty
These include use certainty factors probabilistic methods Bayesian inference Dempster Shafer theory multi valued fuzzy logic various connectionist approaches
Types reasoning system This section provides non exhaustive informal categorisation common types reasoning system
These categories absolute
They overlap significant degree share number techniques methods algorithms
Constraint solvers Constraint solvers solve constraint satisfaction problems CSPs
They support constraint programming
A constraint must met valid solution problem
Constraints defined declaratively applied variables within given domains
Constraint solvers use search backtracking constraint propagation techniques find solutions determine optimal solutions
They may employ forms linear nonlinear programming
They often used perform optimization within highly combinatorial problem spaces
For example may used calculate optimal scheduling design efficient integrated circuits maximise productivity manufacturing process
Theorem provers Theorem provers use automated reasoning techniques determine proofs mathematical theorems
They may also used verify existing proofs
In addition academic use typical applications theorem provers include verification correctness integrated circuits software programs engineering designs etc
Logic programs Logic programs LPs software programs written using programming languages whose primitives expressions provide direct representations constructs drawn mathematical logic
An example general purpose logic programming language Prolog
LPs represent direct application logic programming solve problems
Logic programming characterised highly declarative approaches based formal logic wide application across many disciplines
Rule engines Rule engines represent conditional logic discrete rules
Rule sets managed applied separately functionality
They wide applicability across many domains
Many rule engines implement reasoning capabilities
A common approach implement production systems support forward backward chaining
Each rule production binds conjunction predicate clauses list executable actions
At run time rule engine matches productions facts executes fires associated action list match
If actions remove modify facts assert new facts engine immediately computes set matches
Rule engines widely used model apply business rules control decision making automated processes enforce business technical policies
Deductive classifier Deductive classifiers arose slightly later rule based systems component new type artificial intelligence knowledge representation tool known frame languages
A frame language describes problem domain set classes subclasses relations among classes
It similar object oriented model
Unlike object oriented models however frame languages formal semantics based first order logic
They utilize semantics provide input deductive classifier
The classifier turn analyze given model known ontology determine various relations described model consistent
If ontology consistent classifier highlight declarations inconsistent
If ontology consistent classifier reasoning draw additional conclusions relations objects ontology
For example may determine object actually subclass instance additional classes described user
Classifiers important technology analyzing ontologies used describe models Semantic web
Machine learning systems Machine learning systems evolve behavior time based experience
This may involve reasoning observed events example data provided training purposes
For example machine learning systems may use inductive reasoning generate hypotheses observed facts
Learning systems search generalised rules functions yield results line observations use generalisations control future behavior
Case based reasoning systems Case based reasoning CBR systems provide solutions problems analysing similarities problems known solutions already exist
They use analogical reasoning infer solutions based case histories
CBR systems commonly used customer technical support call centre scenarios applications industrial manufacture agriculture medicine law many areas
Procedural reasoning systems A procedural reasoning system PRS uses reasoning techniques select plans procedural knowledge base
Each plan represents course action achievement given goal
The PRS implements belief desire intention model reasoning facts beliefs select appropriate plans intentions given goals desires
Typical applications PRS include management monitoring fault detection systems

Contextual image classification topic pattern recognition computer vision approach classification based contextual information images
Contextual means approach focusing relationship nearby pixels also called neighbourhood
The goal approach classify images using contextual information
Introduction Similar processing language single word may multiple meanings unless context provided patterns within sentences informative segments care
For images principle
Find patterns associate proper meanings
As image illustrated small portion image shown difficult tell image
Even try another portion image still difficult classify image
However increase contextual image makes sense recognize
As full images shows almost everyone classify easily
During procedure segmentation methods use contextual information sensitive noise variations thus result segmentation contain great deal misclassified regions often regions small e g one pixel
Compared techniques approach robust noise substantial variations takes continuity segments account
Several methods approach described
Applications Functioning post processing filter labelled image This approach effective small regions caused noise
And small regions usually formed pixels one pixel
The probable label assigned regions
However drawback method
The small regions also formed correct regions rather noise case method actually making classification worse
This approach widely used remote sensing applications
Improving post processing classification This two stage classification process For pixel label pixel form new feature vector
Use new feature vector combine contextual information assign final label Merging pixels earlier stages Instead using single pixels neighbour pixels merged homogeneous regions benefiting contextual information
And provide regions classifier
Acquiring pixel feature neighbourhood The original spectral data enriched adding contextual information carried neighbour pixels even replaced occasions
This kind pre processing methods widely used textured image recognition
The typical approaches include mean values variances texture description etc
Combining spectral spatial information The classifier uses grey level pixel neighbourhood contextual information assign labels pixels
In case information combination spectral spatial information
Powered Bayes minimum error classifier Contextual classification image data based Bayes minimum error classifier also known naive Bayes classifier
Present pixel A pixel denoted x displaystyle x_

Algorithms Template matching The template matching brute force implementation approach
The concept first create set templates look small parts image match template
This method computationally high inefficient
It keeps entire templates list whole process number combinations extremely high
For n displaystyle times n pixel image could maximum n displaystyle times n combinations leads high computation
This method top method often called table look dictionary look
Lower order Markov chain The Markov chain also applied pattern recognition
The pixels image recognised set random variables use lower order Markov chain find relationship among pixels
The image treated virtual line method uses conditional probability
Hilbert space filling curves The Hilbert curve runs unique pattern whole image traverses every pixel without visiting twice keeps continuous curve
It fast efficient
Markov meshes The lower order Markov chain Hilbert space filling curves mentioned treating image line structure
The Markov meshes however take two dimensional information account
Dependency tree The dependency tree method using tree dependency approximate probability distributions

A computer assisted proof mathematical proof least partially generated computer
Most computer aided proofs date implementations large proofs exhaustion mathematical theorem
The idea use computer program perform lengthy computations provide proof result computations implies given theorem
In four color theorem first major theorem verified using computer program
Attempts also made area artificial intelligence research create smaller explicit new proofs mathematical theorems bottom using machine reasoning techniques heuristic search
Such automated theorem provers proved number new results found new proofs known theorems
Additionally interactive proof assistants allow mathematicians develop human readable proofs nonetheless formally verified correctness
Since proofs generally human surveyable albeit difficulty proof Robbins conjecture share controversial implications computer aided proofs exhaustion
Methods One method using computers mathematical proofs means called validated numerics rigorous numerics
This means computing numerically yet mathematical rigour
One uses set valued arithmetic inclusion principle order ensure set valued output numerical program encloses solution original mathematical problem
This done controlling enclosing propagating round truncation errors using example interval arithmetic
More precisely one reduces computation sequence elementary operations say displaystyle
In computer result elementary operation rounded computer precision
However one construct interval provided upper lower bounds result elementary operation
Then one proceeds replacing numbers intervals performing elementary operations intervals representable numbers
Philosophical objections Computer assisted proofs subject controversy mathematical world Thomas Tymoczko first articulate objections
Those adhere Tymoczko arguments believe lengthy computer assisted proofs sense real mathematical proofs involve many logical steps practically verifiable human beings mathematicians effectively asked replace logical deduction assumed axioms trust empirical computational process potentially affected errors computer program well defects runtime environment hardware Other mathematicians believe lengthy computer assisted proofs regarded calculations rather proofs proof algorithm proved valid use regarded mere verification
Arguments computer assisted proofs subject errors source programs compilers hardware resolved providing formal proof correctness computer program approach successfully applied four color theorem well replicating result using different programming languages different compilers different computer hardware
Another possible way verifying computer aided proofs generate reasoning steps machine readable form use automated theorem prover demonstrate correctness
This approach using computer program prove another program correct appeal computer proof skeptics see adding another layer complexity without addressing perceived need human understanding
Another argument computer aided proofs lack mathematical elegance provide insights new useful concepts
In fact argument could advanced lengthy proof exhaustion
An additional philosophical issue raised computer aided proofs whether make mathematics quasi empirical science scientific method becomes important application pure reason area abstract mathematical concepts
This directly relates argument within mathematics whether mathematics based ideas merely exercise formal symbol manipulation
It also raises question whether according Platonist view possible mathematical objects sense already exist whether computer aided mathematics observational science like astronomy rather experimental one like physics chemistry
This controversy within mathematics occurring time questions asked physics community whether twenty first century theoretical physics becoming mathematical leaving behind experimental roots

Automatic number plate recognition ANPR see also names technology uses optical character recognition images read vehicle registration plates create vehicle location data
It use existing closed circuit television road rule enforcement cameras cameras specifically designed task
ANPR used police forces around world law enforcement purposes including check vehicle registered licensed
It also used electronic toll collection pay per use roads method cataloguing movements traffic example highways agencies
Automatic number plate recognition used store images captured cameras well text license plate configurable store photograph driver
Systems commonly use infrared lighting allow camera take picture time day night
ANPR technology must take account plate variations place place
Concerns systems centered privacy issues government tracking citizens movements misidentification high error rates increased government spending
Critics described form mass surveillance
Other names ANPR sometimes known various terms Automatic automated license plate recognition ALPR Automatic automated license plate reader ALPR Automatic vehicle identification AVI Automatisk nummerpladegenkendelse ANPG Car plate recognition CPR License plate recognition LPR Lecture automatique de plaques immatriculation LAPI Mobile license plate reader MLPR Vehicle license plate recognition VLPR Vehicle recognition identification VRI Development ANPR invented Police Scientific Development Branch Britain
Prototype systems working contracts awarded produce industrial systems first EMI Electronics Computer Recognition Systems CRS Wokingham UK
Early trial systems deployed A road Dartford Tunnel
The first arrest detection stolen car made
However ANPR become widely used new developments cheaper easier use software pioneered
The collection ANPR data future use e solving unidentified crimes documented early
The first documented case ANPR used help solve murder occurred November Bradford UK ANPR played vital role locating subsequently convicting killers Sharon Beshenivsky
Components The software aspect system runs standard home computer hardware linked applications databases
It first uses series image manipulation techniques detect normalize enhance image number plate optical character recognition OCR extract alphanumerics license plate
ANPR systems generally deployed one two basic approaches one allows entire process performed lane location real time transmits images many lanes remote computer location performs OCR process later point time
When done lane site information captured plate alphanumeric date time lane identification information required completed approximately milliseconds
This information easily transmitted remote computer processing necessary stored lane later retrieval
In arrangement typically large numbers PCs used server farm handle high workloads found London congestion charge project
Often systems requirement forward images remote server require larger bandwidth transmission media
Technology ANPR uses optical character recognition OCR images taken cameras
When Dutch vehicle registration plates switched different style one changes made font introducing small gaps letters P R make distinct therefore legible systems
Some license plate arrangements use variations font sizes positioning ANPR systems must able cope differences order truly effective
More complicated systems cope international variants though many programs individually tailored country
The cameras used existing road rule enforcement closed circuit television cameras well mobile units usually attached vehicles
Some systems use infrared cameras take clearer image plates
In mobile systems During significant advances technology took automatic number plate recognition ANPR systems limited expensive hard set fixed based applications simple point shoot mobile ones
This made possible creation software ran cheaper PC based non specialist hardware also longer needed given pre defined angles direction size speed plates would passing camera field view
Further scaled components cost effective price points led record number deployments law enforcement agencies around world
Smaller cameras ability read license plates higher speeds along smaller durable processors fit trunks police vehicles allowed law enforcement officers patrol daily benefit license plate reading real time interdict immediately
Despite effectiveness noteworthy challenges related mobile ANPRs
One biggest processor cameras must work fast enough accommodate relative speeds mph km h likely scenario case oncoming traffic
This equipment must also efficient since power source vehicle battery equipment must small minimize space requires
Relative speed one issue affects camera ability actually read license plate
Algorithms must able compensate variables affect ANPR ability produce accurate read time day weather angles cameras license plates
A system illumination wavelengths also direct impact resolution accuracy read conditions
Installing ANPR cameras law enforcement vehicles requires careful consideration juxtaposition cameras license plates read
Using right number cameras positioning accurately optimal results prove challenging given various missions environments hand
Highway patrol requires forward looking cameras span multiple lanes able read license plates high speeds
City patrol needs shorter range lower focal length cameras capturing plates parked cars
Parking lots perpendicularly parked cars often require specialized camera short focal length
Most technically advanced systems flexible configured number cameras ranging one four easily repositioned needed
States rear license plates additional challenge since forward looking camera ineffective oncoming traffic
In case one camera may turned backwards
Algorithms There seven primary algorithms software requires identifying license plate Plate localization responsible finding isolating plate picture
Plate orientation sizing compensates skew plate adjusts dimensions required size
Normalization adjusts brightness contrast image
Character segmentation finds individual characters plates
Optical character recognition
Syntactical Geometrical analysis check characters positions country specific rules
The averaging recognised value multiple fields images produce reliable confident result
Especially since single image may contain reflected light flare partially obscured temporary effect The complexity subsections program determines accuracy system
During third phase normalization systems use edge detection techniques increase picture difference letters plate backing
A median filter may also used reduce visual noise image
Difficulties There number possible difficulties software must able cope
These include Poor file resolution usually plate far away sometimes resulting use low quality camera
Blurry images particularly motion blur
Poor lighting low contrast due overexposure reflection shadows
An object obscuring part plate quite often tow bar dirt plate
Read license plates different front back towed trailers campers etc
Vehicle lane change camera angle view license plate reading
A different font popular vanity plates countries allow plates eliminating problem
Circumvention techniques
Lack coordination countries states
Two cars different countries states number different design plate While problems corrected within software primarily left hardware side system work solutions difficulties
Increasing height camera may avoid problems objects vehicles obscuring plate introduces increases problems adjusting increased skew plate
On cars tow bars may obscure one two characters license plate
Bikes bike racks also obscure number plate though countries jurisdictions Victoria Australia bike plates supposed fitted
Some small scale systems allow errors license plate
When used giving specific vehicles access barricaded area decision may made acceptable error rate one character
This likelihood unauthorized car similar license plate seen quite small
However level inaccuracy would acceptable applications ANPR system
Imaging hardware At front end ANPR system imaging hardware captures image license plates
The initial image capture forms critically important part ANPR system accordance garbage garbage principle computing often determine overall performance
License plate capture typically performed specialized cameras designed specifically task although new software techniques implemented support IP based surveillance camera increase utility ANPR perimeter security applications
Factors pose difficulty license plate imaging cameras include speed vehicles recorded varying level ambient light headlight glare harsh environmental conditions
Most dedicated license plate capture cameras incorporate infrared illumination order solve problems lighting plate reflectivity
Many countries use license plates retroreflective
This returns light back source thus improves contrast image
In countries characters plate reflective giving high level contrast reflective background lighting conditions
A camera makes use active infrared imaging normal colour filter lens infrared illuminator next benefits greatly infrared waves reflected back plate
This possible dedicated ANPR cameras however cameras used purposes must rely heavily software capabilities
Further full colour image required well use ANPR retrieved details necessary one infrared enabled camera one normal colour camera working together
To avoid blurring ideal shutter speed dedicated camera set second
It also important camera uses global shutter opposed rolling shutter assure taken images distortion free
Because car moving slower shutter speeds could result image blurred read using OCR software especially camera much higher vehicle
In slow moving traffic camera lower level vehicle angle approaching camera shutter speed need fast
Shutter speeds second cope traffic moving mph km h second mph km h
License plate capture cameras produce usable images vehicles traveling mph km h
To maximize chances effective license plate capture installers carefully consider positioning camera relative target capture area
Exceeding threshold angles incidence camera lens license plate greatly reduce probability obtaining usable images due distortion
Manufacturers developed tools help eliminate errors physical installation license plate capture cameras

Owners cars driving inner city must pay charge
The number tolls passed depends distance travelled particular freeway
Some freeways ANPR N N N etc
Sweden In Stockholm Sweden ANPR used Stockholm congestion tax owners cars driving inner city must pay charge depending time day
From also Gothenburg congestion tax also includes vehicles passing city main highways
Private use Several UK companies agencies use ANPR systems
These include Vehicle Operator Services Agency VOSA Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency DVLA Transport London
Other uses ANPR systems may also used Section control measure average vehicle speed longer distances
Border crossings Automobile repossessions Petrol stations log motorist drives away without paying fuel
A marketing tool log patterns use Targeted advertising la Minority Report style billboards
Traffic management systems determine traffic flow using time takes vehicles pass two ANPR sites Analyses travel behaviour route choice origin destination etc
transport planning purposes Drive Through Customer Recognition automatically recognize customers based license plate offer items ordered last time used service
To assist visitor management systems recognizing guest vehicles
Police Auxiliary Police Car parking companies To raise lower automatic bollards Hotels Enforcing Move Over laws emergency vehicles Automated emissions testing Challenges Circumvention Vehicle owners used variety techniques attempt evade ANPR systems road rule enforcement cameras general
One method increases reflective properties lettering makes likely system unable locate plate produce high enough level contrast able read
This typically done using plate cover spray though claims regarding effectiveness latter disputed
In jurisdictions covers illegal covered existing laws countries law disallow use sprays
Other users attempted smear license plate dirt utilize covers mask plate
Novelty frames around Texas license plates made illegal Texas September Texas Senate Bill caused problems ANPR devices
That law made Class C misdemeanor punishable fine US Class B punishable fine US days jail proven owner deliberately obscure plates
The law later clarified allow Novelty frames
If ANPR system cannot read plate flag image attention human operators looking see able identify alphanumerics
In order avoid surveillance penalty charges upsurge car cloning
This usually achieved copying registration plates another car similar model age
This difficult detect especially cloners may change registration plates travel behavior hinder investigations
In researchers Sunflex Zone Ltd created privacy license plate frame uses near infrared light make license plate unreadable license plate recognition systems
Controversy The introduction ANPR systems led fears misidentification furthering style surveillance
In United States Gregg Easterbrook oppose call machines issue speeding tickets red light tickets beginning slippery slope towards automated justice system A machine classifies person offender confront accuser accuser wise establish principle machine says something illegal presumed guilty
Similar criticisms raised countries
Easterbrook also argues technology employed maximize revenue state rather promote safety
The electronic surveillance system produces tickets US often excess virtually impossible citizen contest court without help attorney
The revenues generated machines shared generously private corporation builds operates creating strong incentive tweak system generate many tickets possible
Older systems notably unreliable UK known lead charges made incorrectly vehicle owner pay order issued proof offense
Improvements technology drastically decreased error rates false accusations still frequent enough problem
Perhaps best known incident involving abuse ANPR database North America case Edmonton Sun reporter Kerry Diotte
Diotte wrote article critical Edmonton police use traffic cameras revenue enhancement retaliation added ANPR database high risk drivers attempt monitor habits create opportunity arrest
The police chief several officers fired result The Office Privacy Commissioner Canada expressed public concern growing police use technology spy motorists
Other concerns include storage information could used identify people store details driving habits daily life contravening Data Protection Act along similar legislation see personally identifiable information
The laws UK strict system uses CCTV footage identify individuals Also concern safety data mined following discovery police surveillance records lost gutter There also case UK saying use ANPR cameras unlawful Regulation Investigatory Powers Act
The breach exists say fact ANPR used monitor activities law abiding citizens treats everyone like suspected criminals intended surveyed Act
The police known refer system ANPR traffic movement database diversion intended purpose identifying vehicles involved criminal activities
The opposing viewpoint plates cloned read innocent motorist vehicle allow elimination vehicle investigation visual examination images stored
Likewise stolen vehicles read ANPR systems time theft report Police assisting investigation
The Associated Press reported August New York Police Department cars license plate tracking equipment purchased federal HIDTA High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area funds used spy Muslims mosques track license plate numbers worshipers
Police unmarked cars outfitted electronic license plate readers would drive street automatically catalog plates everyone parked near mosque amassing covert database would distributed among officers used profile Muslims public In American Civil Liberties Union ACLU released pages data ANPR systems obtained local state federal agencies freedom information laws
The documents paint startling picture technology deployed rules becoming tool mass routine location tracking surveillance wrote ACLU
The ACLU reported many locations devices used store location information vehicles suspected particular offense
Private companies also using license plate readers sharing information collect police little oversight privacy protections
A lack regulation means policies governing long location data kept vary widely ACLU said
In ACLU filed suit Department Homeland Security funds many local state ANPR programs grants agency failed provide access records ACLU requested Freedom Information Act programs In mid August Boston discovered license plate records million people online unprotected
Plate inconsistency jurisdictional differences Many ANPR systems claim accuracy trained match plates single jurisdiction region fail trying recognize plates jurisdictions due variations format font color layout plate features
Some jurisdictions offer vanity affinity plates particularly US create many variations within single jurisdiction From time time US states make significant changes license plate protocol affect OCR accuracy
They may add character add new license plate design
ALPR systems must adapt changes quickly order effective
Another challenge ALPR systems states license plate protocol
For example one state uses standard three letters followed four numbers
So time ALPR systems alarms user responsibility make sure plate caused alarm matches state associated license plate listed car computer
For maximum effectiveness ANPR system able recognize plates jurisdiction jurisdiction associated many variables make tasks difficult
Currently least one US ANPR provider PlateSmart claims system independently reviewed able accurately recognize US state jurisdiction license plates one European ANPR provider claims system differentiate EU plate jurisdictions
Accuracy measurement ANPR system performance A ANPR software vendors publish accuracy results based image benchmarks
These results may vary depending images vendor chosen include test
In Sighthound reported accuracy private image benchmark
In OpenALPR reported accuracy rates commercial software range public image benchmark
April research Brazil Federal University Paraná Federal University Minas Gerais compared systems reported median recognition rate stated significant improvement rate obtained previous works

A pedagogical agent concept borrowed computer science artificial intelligence applied education usually part intelligent tutoring system ITS
It simulated human like interface learner content educational environment
A pedagogical agent designed model type interactions student another person
Mabanza de Wet define character enacted computer interacts user socially engaging manner
A pedagogical agent assigned different roles learning environment tutor co learner depending desired purpose agent
A tutor agent plays role teacher co learner agent plays role learning companion
History The history Pedagogical Agents closely aligned history computer animation
As computer animation progressed adopted educators enhance computerized learning including lifelike interface program learner
The first versions pedagogical agent cartoon person like Microsoft Clippy helped users Microsoft Office load use program features
However developments computer animation pedagogical agents look lifelike
By call develop modular reusable agents decrease time expertise required create pedagogical agent
There also call enact agent standards
The standardization usability pedagogical agents less issue since decrease cost widespread availability animation tools
Individualized pedagogical agents found across disciplines including medicine math law language learning automotive armed forces
They used applications directed every age preschool adult
Learning theories related pedagogical agent design Distributed cognition theory Distributed cognition theory method cognition progresses context collaboration others
Pedagogical agents designed assist cognitive transfer learner operating artifacts partners collaborative role learning
To support performance action user pedagogical agent act cognitive tool long agent equipped knowledge user lacks
The interactions user pedagogical agent facilitate social relationship
The pedagogical agent may fulfill role working partner
Socio cultural learning theory Socio cultural learning theory user develops involved learning activities interaction agents
A pedagogical agent intervene user requests provide support tasks user cannot address potentially extend learners cognitive reach
Interaction pedagogical agent may elicit variety emotions learner
The learner may become excited confused frustrated discouraged
These emotions affect learners motivation
Extraneous Cognitive Load Extraneous cognitive load extra effort exerted individual working memory due way information presented
A pedagogical agent increase user cognitive load distracting becoming focus attention causing split attention instructional material agent
Agents reduce perceived cognitive load providing narration personalization also promote user interest motivation
While research reduction cognitive load pedagogical agents minimal studies shown agents increase
Effectiveness It suggested researchers pedagogical agents may take different roles learning environment
Examples roles supplanting scaffolding coaching testing demonstrating modelling procedure
A pedagogical agent tutor demonstrated add benefit educational strategy equivalent lessons without pedagogical agent
According Richard Mayer support research pedagogical agent increasing learning presenter social cues
A co learner pedagogical agent believed increase student self efficacy
By pointing important features instructional content pedagogical agent fulfill signaling function research multimedia learning shown enhance learning
Research demonstrated human human interaction may completely replaced pedagogical agents learners may prefer agents non agent multimedia systems
This finding supported social agency theory
Much like varying effectiveness pedagogical agent roles learning environment agents take account user affect mixed results
Research shown pedagogical agents make use users affect found increase user knowledge retention motivation perceived self efficacy
However broad range modalities affective expressions often difficult utilize
Additionally agents detect user affective state precision remains challenging displays affect different across individuals
Design Attractiveness The appearance pedagogical agent manipulated meet learning requirements
The attractiveness pedagogical agent enhance student learning users opposite gender pedagogical agent
Male students prefer sexy appearance female pedagogical agents dislike sexy appearance male agents
Female students attracted sexy appearance either male female pedagogical agents
Affective Response Pedagogical agents reached point convey elicit emotion also reason respond
These agents often designed elicit respond affective actions users various modalities speech facial expressions body gestures
They respond affective state given user make use modalities using wide array sensors incorporated design agent
Specifically education training applications pedagogical agents often designed increasingly recognize users learners exhibit frustration boredom confusion states flow
The added recognition agents step toward making emotionally intelligent comforting motivating users interact
Digital Representation The design pedagogical agent often begins digital representation whether D D static animated
Several studies developed pedagogical agents static animated evaluated relative benefits
Similar design considerations improved learning static animated agents remains questionable
One study showed appearance agent portrayed using static image impact user recall based visual appearance
Other research found results suggest static agent images improve learning outcomes
However several studies found user learned pedagogical agent animated rather static
Recently meta analysis research found negligible improvement learning via pedagogical agents suggesting work needs done area support claims

In artificial intelligence related fields argumentation framework argumentation system way deal contentious information draw conclusions
In abstract argumentation framework entry level information set abstract arguments instance represent data proposition
Conflicts arguments represented binary relation set arguments
In concrete terms represent argumentation framework directed graph nodes arguments arrows represent attack relation
There exist extensions Dung framework like logic based argumentation frameworks value based argumentation frameworks
Abstract argumentation frameworks Formal framework Abstract argumentation frameworks also called argumentation frameworks à la Dung defined formally pair A set abstract elements called arguments denoted A displaystyle A A binary relation A displaystyle A called attack relation denoted R displaystyle R For instance argumentation system S A R displaystyle S langle A R rangle A b c displaystyle A b c R b b c c displaystyle R b b c c contains four arguments b c displaystyle b c displaystyle three attacks displaystyle attacks b displaystyle b b displaystyle b attacks c displaystyle c displaystyle attacks c displaystyle c
Dung defines notions argument A displaystyle A acceptable respect E A displaystyle E subseteq A E displaystyle E defends displaystyle b A displaystyle forall b A b R c E displaystyle b R exists c E c b R displaystyle c b R set arguments E displaystyle E conflict free attack arguments formally b E b R displaystyle forall b E b R set arguments E displaystyle E admissible conflict free arguments acceptable respect E displaystyle E
Different semantics acceptance Extensions To decide argument accepted several arguments accepted together Dung defines several semantics acceptance allows given argumentation system sets arguments called extensions computed
For instance given S A R displaystyle S langle A R rangle E displaystyle E complete extension S displaystyle S admissible set every acceptable argument respect E displaystyle E belongs E displaystyle E E displaystyle E preferred extension S displaystyle S maximal element respect set theoretical inclusion among admissible sets respect S displaystyle S E displaystyle E stable extension S displaystyle S conflict free set attacks every argument belong E displaystyle E formally A E b E displaystyle forall A backslash E exists b E b R displaystyle b R E displaystyle E unique grounded extension S displaystyle S smallest element respect set inclusion among complete extensions S displaystyle S There exists inclusions sets extensions built semantics Every stable extension preferred Every preferred extension complete The grounded extension complete If system well founded exists infinite sequence n displaystyle a_ a_ dots a_ n dots R displaystyle forall a_ a_ R semantics coincide one extension grounded stable preferred complete Some semantics defined One introduce notation E x σ S displaystyle Ext_ sigma S note set σ displaystyle sigma extensions system S displaystyle S
In case system S displaystyle S figure E x σ S displaystyle Ext_ sigma S every Dung semantic system well founded
That explains semantics coincide accepted arguments displaystyle displaystyle
Labellings Labellings expressive way extensions express acceptance arguments
Concretely labelling mapping associates every argument label argument accepted argument rejected undec argument undefined accepted refused
One also note labelling set pairs r g u e n l b e l displaystyle mathit argument mathit label
Such mapping make sense without additional constraint
The notion reinstatement labelling guarantees sense mapping
L displaystyle L reinstatement labelling system S A R displaystyle S langle A R rangle A L n displaystyle forall A L mathit b A displaystyle forall b A b R L b u displaystyle b R L b mathit A L u displaystyle forall A L mathit b A displaystyle exists b A b R displaystyle b R L b n displaystyle L b mathit A L u n e c displaystyle forall A L mathit undec L n displaystyle L neq mathit L u displaystyle L neq mathit One convert every extension reinstatement labelling arguments extension attacked argument extension others undec
Conversely one build extension reinstatement labelling keeping arguments
Indeed Caminada proved reinstatement labellings complete extensions mapped bijective way
Moreover Datung semantics associated particular sets reinstatement labellings
Reinstatement labellings distinguish arguments accepted attacked accepted arguments undefined arguments defended cannot defend
An argument undec attacked least another undec
If attacked arguments must attacked argument
The unique reinstatement labelling corresponds system S displaystyle S L n b u c u n displaystyle L mathit b mathit c mathit mathit
Inference argumentation system In general case several extensions computed given semantic σ displaystyle sigma agent reasons system use several mechanisms infer information Credulous inference agent accepts argument belongs least one σ displaystyle sigma extensions case agent risks accepting arguments acceptable together displaystyle attacks b displaystyle b displaystyle b displaystyle b belongs extension Skeptical inference agent accepts argument belongs every σ displaystyle sigma extension
In case agent risks deducing little information intersection extensions empty small cardinal For two methods infer information one identify set accepted arguments respectively C r σ S displaystyle Cr_ sigma S set arguments credulously accepted semantic σ displaystyle sigma S c σ S displaystyle Sc_ sigma S set arguments accepted skeptically semantic σ displaystyle sigma σ displaystyle sigma missed possible ambiguity semantic
Of course one extension instance system well founded problem simple agent accepts arguments unique extension rejects others
The reasoning done labellings correspond chosen semantic argument accepted labelling refused labelling others undecided state status arguments remind epistemic states belief AGM framework dynamic beliefs
Equivalence argumentation frameworks There exists several criteria equivalence argumentation frameworks
Most criteria concern sets extensions set accepted arguments
Formally given semantic σ displaystyle sigma E Q displaystyle mathit EQ_ two argumentation frameworks equivalent set σ displaystyle sigma extensions S S E x σ S E x σ S displaystyle S_ equiv _ S_ Leftrightarrow Ext_ sigma S_ Ext_ sigma S_ E Q displaystyle mathit EQ_ two argumentation frameworks equivalent accept skeptically arguments S S S c σ S S c σ S displaystyle S_ equiv _ S_ Leftrightarrow Sc_ sigma S_ Sc_ sigma S_ E Q displaystyle mathit EQ_ two argumentation frameworks equivalent accept credulously arguments S S C r σ S C r σ S displaystyle S_ equiv _ S_ Leftrightarrow Cr_ sigma S_ Cr_ sigma S_ The strong equivalence says two systems S displaystyle S_ S displaystyle S_ equivalent system S displaystyle S_ union S displaystyle S_ S displaystyle S_ equivalent given criterion union S displaystyle S_ S displaystyle S_
Other kinds The abstract framework Dung instantiated several particular cases
Logic based argumentation frameworks In case logic based argumentation frameworks argument abstract entity pair first part minimal consistent set formulae enough prove formula second part argument
Formally argument pair Φ α displaystyle Phi alpha Φ displaystyle Phi nvdash bot Φ α displaystyle Phi vdash alpha Φ displaystyle Phi minimal set Δ displaystyle Delta satisfying α displaystyle alpha Δ displaystyle Delta set formulae used agent reason One calls α displaystyle alpha consequence Φ displaystyle Phi Φ displaystyle Phi support α displaystyle alpha
In case attack relation given explicit way subset Cartesian product A A displaystyle A times A property indicates argument attacks another
For instance Relation defeater Ψ β displaystyle Psi beta attacks Φ α displaystyle Phi alpha β ϕ ϕ n displaystyle beta vdash neg phi _ wedge dots wedge phi _ n ϕ ϕ n Φ displaystyle phi _ dots phi _ n subseteq Phi Relation undercut Ψ β displaystyle Psi beta attacks Φ α displaystyle Phi alpha β ϕ ϕ n displaystyle beta neg phi _ wedge dots wedge phi _ n ϕ ϕ n Φ displaystyle phi _ dots phi _ n subseteq Phi Relation rebuttal Ψ β displaystyle Psi beta attacks Φ α displaystyle Phi alpha β α displaystyle beta Leftrightarrow neg alpha tautologyGiven particular attack relation one build graph reason similar way abstract argumentation frameworks use semantics build extension skeptical credulous inference difference information inferred logic based argumentation framework set formulae consequences accepted arguments
Value based argumentation frameworks The value based argumentation frameworks come idea exchange arguments stronger others respect certain value advance success attack arguments depends difference values
Formally value based argumentation framework tuple V A F A R V val valprefs displaystyle VAF langle A R V textit val textit valprefs rangle A displaystyle A R displaystyle R similar standard framework set arguments binary relation set V displaystyle V non empty set values val displaystyle textit val mapping associates element A displaystyle A element V displaystyle V valprefs displaystyle textit valprefs preference relation transitive irreflexive asymmetric V V displaystyle V times V
In framework argument displaystyle defeats another argument b displaystyle b displaystyle attacks b displaystyle b standard meaning b R displaystyle b R val b v l valprefs displaystyle textit val b val textit valprefs value advanced b displaystyle b preferred one advanced displaystyle One remarks attack succeeds arguments associated value preference respective values
Assumption based argumentation frameworks In assumption based argumentation ABA frameworks arguments defined set rules attacks defined terms assumptions contraries

Question answering QA computer science discipline within fields information retrieval natural language processing NLP concerned building systems automatically answer questions posed humans natural language
Overview A question answering implementation usually computer program may construct answers querying structured database knowledge information usually knowledge base
More commonly question answering systems pull answers unstructured collection natural language documents
Some examples natural language document collections used question answering systems include local collection reference texts internal organization documents web pages compiled newswire reports set Wikipedia pages subset World Wide Web pagesQuestion answering research attempts deal wide range question types including fact list definition How Why hypothetical semantically constrained cross lingual questions
Closed domain question answering deals questions specific domain example medicine automotive maintenance exploit domain specific knowledge frequently formalized ontologies
Alternatively closed domain might refer situation limited type questions accepted questions asking descriptive rather procedural information
Question answering systems context machine reading applications also constructed medical domain instance related Alzheimers disease Open domain question answering deals questions nearly anything rely general ontologies world knowledge
On hand systems usually much data available extract answer
History Two early question answering systems BASEBALL LUNAR
BASEBALL answered questions US baseball league period one year
LUNAR turn answered questions geological analysis rocks returned Apollo moon missions
Both question answering systems effective chosen domains
In fact LUNAR demonstrated lunar science convention able answer questions domain posed people untrained system
Further restricted domain question answering systems developed following years
The common feature systems core database knowledge system hand written experts chosen domain
The language abilities BASEBALL LUNAR used techniques similar ELIZA DOCTOR first chatterbot programs
SHRDLU highly successful question answering program developed Terry Winograd late early
It simulated operation robot toy world blocks world offered possibility asking robot questions state world
Again strength system choice specific domain simple world rules physics easy encode computer program
In knowledge bases developed targeted narrower domains knowledge
The question answering systems developed interface expert systems produced repeatable valid responses questions within area knowledge
These expert systems closely resembled modern question answering systems except internal architecture
Expert systems rely heavily expert constructed organized knowledge bases whereas many modern question answering systems rely statistical processing large unstructured natural language text corpus
The saw development comprehensive theories computational linguistics led development ambitious projects text comprehension question answering
One example system Unix Consultant UC developed Robert Wilensky U C
Berkeley late
The system answered questions pertaining Unix operating system
It comprehensive hand crafted knowledge base domain aimed phrasing answer accommodate various types users
Another project LILOG text understanding system operated domain tourism information German city
The systems developed UC LILOG projects never went past stage simple demonstrations helped development theories computational linguistics reasoning
Specialized natural language question answering systems developed EAGLi health life scientists Wolfram Alpha online computational knowledge engine answers factual queries directly computing answer externally sourced curated data
Architecture As question answering systems typically included question classifier module determines type question type answer
A multiagent question answering architecture proposed domain represented agent tries answer questions taking account specific knowledge meta agent controls cooperation question answering agents chooses relevant answer
Question answering methods Question answering dependent good search corpus without documents containing answer little question answering system
It thus makes sense larger collection sizes generally lend well better question answering performance unless question domain orthogonal collection
The notion data redundancy massive collections web means nuggets information likely phrased many different ways differing contexts documents leading two benefits By right information appear many forms burden question answering system perform complex NLP techniques understand text lessened
Correct answers filtered false positives relying correct answer appear times documents instances incorrect ones Some question answering systems rely heavily automated reasoning
There number question answering systems designed Prolog logic programming language associated artificial intelligence
Open domain question answering In information retrieval open domain question answering system aims returning answer response user question
The returned answer form short texts rather list relevant documents
The system uses combination techniques computational linguistics information retrieval knowledge representation finding answers
The system takes natural language question input rather set keywords example When national day China
The sentence transformed query logical form
Having input form natural language question makes system user friendly harder implement various question types system identify correct one order give sensible answer
Assigning question type question crucial task entire answer extraction process relies finding correct question type hence correct answer type
Keyword extraction first step identifying input question type
In cases clear words indicate question type directly
e
Who Where How many words tell system answers type Person Location Number respectively
In example word When indicates answer type Date
POS part speech tagging syntactic parsing techniques also used determine answer type
In case subject Chinese National Day predicate adverbial modifier therefore answer type Date
Unfortunately interrogative words like Which What How give clear answer types
Each words represent one type
In situations like words question need considered
First thing find words indicate meaning question
A lexical dictionary WordNet used understanding context
Once question type identified information retrieval system used find set documents containing correct key words
A tagger NP Verb Group chunker used verify whether correct entities relations mentioned found documents
For questions Who Where named entity recogniser used find relevant Person Location names retrieved documents
Only relevant paragraphs selected ranking
A vector space model used strategy classifying candidate answers
Check answer correct type determined question type analysis stage
An inference technique also used validate candidate answers
A score given candidates according number question words contains close words candidate closer better
The answer translated compact meaningful representation parsing
In previous example expected output answer st Oct Mathematical question answering An open source math aware question answering system based Ask Platypus Wikidata published
The system takes English Hindi natural language question input returns mathematical formula retrieved Wikidata succinct answer
The resulting formula translated computable form allowing user insert values variables
Names values variables common constants retrieved Wikidata available
It claimed system outperforms commercial computational mathematical knowledge engine test set
Progress Question answering systems extended recent years encompass additional domains knowledge For example systems developed automatically answer temporal geospatial questions questions definition terminology biographical questions multilingual questions questions content audio images video
Current question answering research topics include interactivity clarification questions answers answer reuse caching semantic parsing answer presentation knowledge representation reasoning social media analysis question answering systems sentiment analysis utilization thematic roles semantic resolution bridge gap syntactically different questions answer bearing texts utilization linguistic resources WordNet FrameNet similar Image captioning visual question answeringIBM question answering system Watson defeated two greatest Jeopardy
champions Brad Rutter Ken Jennings significant margin

AGI also referred strong AI full AI general intelligent action
Some academic sources reserve term strong AI machines experience consciousness
Some authorities emphasize distinction strong AI applied AI also called narrow AI weak AI use software study accomplish specific problem solving reasoning tasks
Weak AI contrast strong AI attempt perform full range human cognitive abilities

Problems requiring AGI solve The difficult problems computers informally known AI complete AI hard implying solving equivalent general aptitude human intelligence strong AI beyond capabilities purpose specific algorithm AI complete problems hypothesised include general computer vision natural language understanding dealing unexpected circumstances solving real world problem AI complete problems cannot solved current computer technology alone also require human computation
This property could useful example test presence humans CAPTCHAs aim computer security repel brute force attacks
AGI research Classical AI Modern AI research began mid
The first generation AI researchers convinced artificial general intelligence possible would exist decades
As AI pioneer Herbert A Simon wrote machines capable within twenty years work man
Their predictions inspiration Stanley Kubrick Arthur C Clarke character HAL embodied AI researchers believed could create year
AI pioneer Marvin Minsky consultant project making HAL realistic possible according consensus predictions time Crevier quotes said subject Within generation problem creating artificial intelligence substantially solved although Minsky states misquoted However early became obvious researchers grossly underestimated difficulty project
Funding agencies became skeptical AGI put researchers increasing pressure produce useful applied AI
As began Japan Fifth Generation Computer Project revived interest AGI setting ten year timeline included AGI goals like carry casual conversation
In response success expert systems industry government pumped money back field
However confidence AI spectacularly collapsed late goals Fifth Generation Computer Project never fulfilled
For second time years AI researchers predicted imminent achievement AGI shown fundamentally mistaken
By AI researchers gained reputation making vain promises
They became reluctant make predictions avoid mention human level artificial intelligence fear labeled wild eyed dreamer
Narrow AI research In early st century mainstream AI achieved far greater commercial success academic respectability focusing specific sub problems produce verifiable results commercial applications artificial neural networks computer vision data mining
These applied AI systems used extensively throughout technology industry research vein heavily funded academia industry
Currently development field considered emerging trend mature stage expected happen years
Most mainstream AI researchers hope strong AI developed combining programs solve various sub problems using integrated agent architecture cognitive architecture subsumption architecture
Hans Moravec wrote I confident bottom route artificial intelligence one day meet traditional top route half way ready provide real world competence commonsense knowledge frustratingly elusive reasoning programs
Fully intelligent machines result metaphorical golden spike driven uniting two efforts
However even fundamental philosophy disputed example Stevan Harnad Princeton concluded paper Symbol Grounding Hypothesis stating The expectation often voiced top symbolic approaches modeling cognition somehow meet bottom sensory approaches somewhere
If grounding considerations paper valid expectation hopelessly modular really one viable route sense symbols ground
A free floating symbolic level like software level computer never reached route vice versa clear even try reach level since looks getting would amount uprooting symbols intrinsic meanings thereby merely reducing functional equivalent programmable computer
Modern artificial general intelligence research Artificial general intelligence AGI describes research aims create machines capable general intelligent action
The term used early Mark Gubrud discussion implications fully automated military production operations
The term introduced popularized Shane Legg Ben Goertzel around
The research objective much older example Doug Lenat Cyc project began Allen Newell Soar project regarded within scope AGI
AGI research activity described Pei Wang Ben Goertzel producing publications preliminary results
The first summer school AGI organized Xiamen China Xiamen university Artificial Brain Laboratory OpenCog
The first university course given Plovdiv University Bulgaria Todor Arnaudov
MIT presented course AGI organized Lex Fridman featuring number guest lecturers
However yet AI researchers devoted little attention AGI claiming intelligence complex completely replicated near term
However small number computer scientists active AGI research many group contributing series AGI conferences
The research extremely diverse often pioneering nature
In introduction book Goertzel says estimates time needed truly flexible AGI built vary years century consensus AGI research community seems timeline discussed Ray Kurzweil The Singularity Near e
plausible However mainstream AI researchers doubt progress rapid
Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include Swiss AI lab IDSIA Nnaisense Vicarious Maluuba OpenCog Foundation Adaptive AI LIDA Numenta associated Redwood Neuroscience Institute
In addition organizations Machine Intelligence Research Institute OpenAI founded influence development path AGI
Finally projects Human Brain Project goal building functioning simulation human brain
A survey AGI categorized forty five known active R D projects explicitly implicitly published research research AGI largest three DeepMind Human Brain Project OpenAI based article
In video game programmer aerospace engineer John Carmack announced plans research AGI
DeepMind success Human Player Simulation e g
AlphaGo made use new concepts Reinforcement learning improve already trained networks new data Unsupervised learning e g
Generative adversarial network get improved networks competition
Processing power needed simulate brain Whole brain emulation A popular discussed approach achieving general intelligent action whole brain emulation
A low level brain model built scanning mapping biological brain detail copying state computer system another computational device
The computer runs simulation model faithful original behave essentially way original brain practical purposes indistinguishably
Whole brain emulation discussed computational neuroscience neuroinformatics context brain simulation medical research purposes
It discussed artificial intelligence research approach strong AI
Neuroimaging technologies could deliver necessary detailed understanding improving rapidly futurist Ray Kurzweil book The Singularity Is Near predicts map sufficient quality become available similar timescale required computing power
Early estimates For low level brain simulation extremely powerful computer would required
The human brain huge number synapses
Each one hundred billion neurons average synaptic connections synapses neurons
It estimated brain three year old child synapses quadrillion
This number declines age stabilizing adulthood
Estimates vary adult ranging synapses trillion
An estimate brain processing power based simple switch model neuron activity around trillion synaptic updates per second SUPS
In Kurzweil looked various estimates hardware required equal human brain adopted figure computations per second cps
For comparison computation equivalent one floating point operation measure used rate current supercomputers computations would equivalent petaFLOPS achieved
He used figure predict necessary hardware would available sometime exponential growth computer power time writing continued
Modelling neurons detail The artificial neuron model assumed Kurzweil used many current artificial neural network implementations simple compared biological neurons
A brain simulation would likely capture detailed cellular behaviour biological neurons presently understood broadest outlines
The overhead introduced full modeling biological chemical physical details neural behaviour especially molecular scale would require computational powers several orders magnitude larger Kurzweil estimate
In addition estimates account glial cells least numerous neurons may outnumber neurons much known play role cognitive processes
Current research There research projects investigating brain simulation using sophisticated neural models implemented conventional computing architectures
The Artificial Intelligence System project implemented non real time simulations brain neurons
It took days cluster processors simulate second model
The Blue Brain project used one fastest supercomputer architectures world IBM Blue Gene platform create real time simulation single rat neocortical column consisting approximately neurons synapses
A longer term goal build detailed functional simulation physiological processes human brain It impossible build human brain years Henry Markram director Blue Brain Project said TED conference Oxford
There also controversial claims simulated cat brain
Neuro silicon interfaces proposed alternative implementation strategy may scale better Hans Moravec addressed arguments brains complicated neurons modeled detail paper When computer hardware match human brain
He measured ability existing software simulate functionality neural tissue specifically retina
His results depend number glial cells kinds processing neurons perform
The actual complexity modeling biological neurons explored OpenWorm project aimed complete simulation worm neurons neural network among cells total
The animal neural network well documented start project
However although task seemed simple beginning models based generic neural network work
Currently efforts focused precise emulation biological neurons partly molecular level result called total success yet
Even number issues solved human brain scale model proportional number neurons amount work along path obvious
Criticisms simulation based approaches A fundamental criticism simulated brain approach derives embodied cognition human embodiment taken essential aspect human intelligence
Many researchers believe embodiment necessary ground meaning
If view correct fully functional brain model need encompass neurons e robotic body
Goertzel proposes virtual embodiment like Second Life yet known whether would sufficient
Desktop computers using microprocessors capable cps Kurzweil non standard unit computations per second see available since
According brain power estimates used Kurzweil Moravec computer capable supporting simulation bee brain despite interest simulation exists
There least three reasons The neuron model seems oversimplified see next section
There insufficient understanding higher cognitive processes establish accurately brain neural activity observed using techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates
Even understanding cognition advances sufficiently early simulation programs likely inefficient therefore need considerably hardware
The brain organism critical may appropriate boundary cognitive model
To simulate bee brain may necessary simulate body environment
The Extended Mind thesis formalizes philosophical concept research cephalopods demonstrated clear examples decentralized system In addition scale human brain currently well constrained
One estimate puts human brain billion neurons trillion synapses
Another estimate billion neurons billion cerebral cortex billion cerebellum
Glial cell synapses currently unquantified known extremely numerous
Strong AI consciousness In philosopher John Searle coined term strong AI part Chinese room argument
He wanted distinguish two different hypotheses artificial intelligence An artificial intelligence system think mind
The word mind specific meaning philosophers used mind body problem philosophy mind
An artificial intelligence system act like thinks mind The first one called strong AI hypothesis second weak AI hypothesis first one makes stronger statement assumes something special happened machine goes beyond abilities test
Searle referred strong AI hypothesis strong AI
This usage also common academic AI research textbooks The weak AI hypothesis equivalent hypothesis artificial general intelligence possible
According Russell Norvig Most AI researchers take weak AI hypothesis granted care strong AI hypothesis
In contrast Searle Ray Kurzweil uses term strong AI describe artificial intelligence system acts like mind regardless whether philosopher would able determine actually mind
In science fiction AGI associated traits consciousness sentience sapience self awareness observed living beings
However according Searle open question whether general intelligence sufficient consciousness
Strong AI defined Kurzweil confused Searle strong AI hypothesis
The strong AI hypothesis claim computer behaves intelligently person must also necessarily mind consciousness
AGI refers amount intelligence machine displays without mind
Consciousness There aspects human mind besides intelligence relevant concept strong AI play major role science fiction ethics artificial intelligence consciousness To subjective experience thought
self awareness To aware oneself separate individual especially aware one thoughts
sentience The ability feel perceptions emotions subjectively
sapience The capacity wisdom These traits moral dimension machine form strong AI may legal rights analogous rights non human animals
Also Bill Joy among others argues machine traits may threat human life dignity
It remains shown whether traits necessary strong AI
The role consciousness clear currently agreed test presence
If machine built device simulates neural correlates consciousness would automatically self awareness
It also possible properties sentience naturally emerge fully intelligent machine becomes natural ascribe properties machines begin act way clearly intelligent
For example intelligent action may sufficient sentience rather way around
Artificial consciousness research Although role consciousness strong AI AGI debatable many AGI researchers regard research investigates possibilities implementing consciousness vital
In early effort Igor Aleksander argued principles creating conscious machine already existed would take forty years train machine understand language
Possible explanations slow progress AI research Since launch AI research growth field slowed time stalled aims creating machines skilled intelligent action human level
A possible explanation delay computers lack sufficient scope memory processing power
In addition level complexity connects process AI research may also limit progress AI research While AI researchers believe strong AI achieved future individuals like Hubert Dreyfus Roger Penrose deny possibility achieving strong AI
John McCarthy one various computer scientists believe human level AI accomplished date cannot accurately predicted Conceptual limitations another possible reason slowness AI research
AI researchers may need modify conceptual framework discipline order provide stronger base contribution quest achieving strong AI
As William Clocksin wrote framework starts Weizenbaum observation intelligence manifests relative specific social cultural contexts Furthermore AI researchers able create computers perform jobs complicated people conversely struggled develop computer capable carrying tasks simple humans Moravec paradox
A problem described David Gelernter people assume thinking reasoning equivalent
However idea whether thoughts creator thoughts isolated individually intrigued AI researchers The problems encountered AI research past decades impeded progress AI
The failed predictions promised AI researchers lack complete understanding human behaviors helped diminish primary idea human level AI
Although progress AI research brought improvement disappointment investigators established optimism potentially achieving goal AI st century Other possible reasons proposed lengthy research progress strong AI
The intricacy scientific problems need fully understand human brain psychology neurophysiology limited many researchers emulating function human brain computer hardware
Many researchers tend underestimate doubt involved future predictions AI without taking issues seriously people overlook solutions problematic questions Clocksin says conceptual limitation may impede progress AI research people may using wrong techniques computer programs implementation equipment
When AI researchers first began aim goal artificial intelligence main interest human reasoning
Researchers hoped establish computational models human knowledge reasoning find design computer specific cognitive task The practice abstraction people tend redefine working particular context research provides researchers concentration concepts
The productive use abstraction AI research comes planning problem solving
Although aim increase speed computation role abstraction posed questions involvement abstraction operators A possible reason slowness AI relates acknowledgement many AI researchers heuristics section contains significant breach computer performance human performance
The specific functions programmed computer may able account many requirements allow match human intelligence
These explanations necessarily guaranteed fundamental causes delay achieving strong AI widely agreed numerous researchers
There many AI researchers debate idea whether machines created emotions
There emotions typical models AI researchers say programming emotions machines allows mind
Emotion sums experiences humans allows remember experiences
David Gelernter writes No computer creative unless simulate nuances human emotion
This concern emotion posed problems AI researchers connects concept strong AI research progresses future
Controversies dangers Feasibility Opinions vary whether artificial general intelligence arrive
At one extreme AI pioneer Herbert A Simon wrote machines capable within twenty years work man
However prediction failed come true
Microsoft co founder Paul Allen believed intelligence unlikely st century would require unforeseeable fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs scientifically deep understanding cognition
Writing The Guardian roboticist Alan Winfield claimed gulf modern computing human level artificial intelligence wide gulf current space flight practical faster light spaceflight
AI experts views feasibility AGI wax wane may seen resurgence
Four polls conducted suggested median guess among experts confident AGI would arrive depending poll mean
It also interesting note experts answered never asked question confidence instead
Further current AGI progress considerations found Tests confirming human level AGI IQ tests AGI
Potential threat human existence The thesis AI poses existential risk risk needs much attention currently gets endorsed many public figures perhaps famous Elon Musk Bill Gates Stephen Hawking
The notable AI researcher endorse thesis Stuart J Russell
Endorsers thesis sometimes express bafflement skeptics Gates states understand people concerned Hawking criticized widespread indifference editorial Many scholars concerned existential risk believe best way forward would conduct possibly massive research solving difficult control problem answer question types safeguards algorithms architectures programmers implement maximize probability recursively improving AI would continue behave friendly rather destructive manner reaches superintelligence The thesis AI pose existential risk also many strong detractors
Skeptics sometimes charge thesis crypto religious irrational belief possibility superintelligence replacing irrational belief omnipotent God extreme Jaron Lanier argues whole concept current machines way intelligent illusion stupendous con wealthy Much existing criticism argues AGI unlikely short term computer scientist Gordon Bell argues human race already destroy reaches technological singularity
Gordon Moore original proponent Moore Law declares I skeptic
I believe technological singularity likely happen least long time
And I know I feel way
Baidu Vice President Andrew Ng states AI existential risk like worrying overpopulation Mars even set foot planet yet

Artificial empathy AE development AI systems companion robots able detect respond human emotions
According scientists although technology perceived scary threatening many people could also significant advantage humans professions traditionally involved emotional role playing health care sector
From care giver perspective instance performing emotional labor beyond requirements paid labor often results chronic stress burnout development feeling desensitized patients
However argued emotional role playing care receiver robot actually positive outcome terms creating conditions less fear concern one predicament best exemplified phrase robot taking care cannot critical
Scholars debate possible outcome technology using two different perspectives
Either AE could help socialization care givers serve role model emotional detachment
Areas research There variety philosophical theoretical applicative questions related AE
For example Which conditions would met robot respond competently human emotion
What models empathy applied Social Assistive Robotics
Does interaction humans robots imitate affective interaction humans
Can robot help science learn affective development humans
Would robots create unforeseen categories inauthentic relations
What relations robots considered truly authentic
Artificial Empathy Human Services Although AI shown replace social workers yet technology begun making waves field

The mind set cognitive faculties including consciousness imagination perception thinking judgement language memory housed brain sometimes including central nervous system
It usually defined faculty entity thoughts consciousness
It holds power imagination recognition appreciation responsible processing feelings emotions resulting attitudes actions There lengthy tradition philosophy religion psychology cognitive science constitutes mind distinguishing properties
One open question regarding nature mind mind body problem investigates relation mind physical brain nervous system
Older viewpoints included dualism idealism considered mind somehow non physical
Modern views often center around physicalism functionalism hold mind roughly identical brain reducible physical phenomena neuronal activity though dualism idealism continue many supporters
Another question concerns types beings capable minds New Scientist September p
For example whether mind exclusive humans possessed also animals living things whether strictly definable characteristic whether mind also property types human made machines Whatever nature generally agreed mind enables subjective awareness intentionality towards environment perceive respond stimuli kind agency consciousness including thinking feeling The concept mind understood many different ways many different cultural religious traditions
Some see mind property exclusive humans whereas others ascribe properties mind non living entities e g
panpsychism animism animals deities
Some earliest recorded speculations linked mind sometimes described identical soul spirit theories concerning life death cosmological natural order example doctrines Zoroaster Buddha Plato Aristotle ancient Greek Indian later Islamic medieval European philosophers
Important philosophers mind include Plato Patanjali Descartes Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume Kant Hegel Schopenhauer Searle Dennett Fodor Nagel Chalmers
Psychologists Freud James computer scientists Turing Putnam developed influential theories nature mind
The possibility nonbiological minds explored field artificial intelligence works closely relation cybernetics information theory understand ways information processing nonbiological machines comparable different mental phenomena human mind The mind also portrayed stream consciousness sense impressions mental phenomena constantly changing
Etymology The original meaning Old English gemynd faculty memory thought general
Hence call mind come mind keep mind mind etc
The word retains sense Scotland
Old English words express mind hyge mind spirit The meaning memory shared Old Norse munr
The word originally PIE verbal root men meaning think remember whence also Latin mens mind Sanskrit manas mind Greek μένος mind courage anger
The generalization mind include mental faculties thought volition feeling memory gradually develops th th centuries
Definitions The attributes make mind debated
Some psychologists argue higher intellectual functions constitute mind particularly reason memory
In view emotions love hate fear joy primitive subjective nature seen different mind
Others argue various rational emotional states cannot separated nature origin therefore considered part mind In popular usage mind frequently synonymous thought private conversation carry inside heads
Thus make minds change minds two minds something
One key attributes mind sense private sphere one owner access
No one else know mind
They interpret consciously unconsciously communicate
Mental faculties Broadly speaking mental faculties various functions mind things mind
Thought mental act allows humans make sense things world represent interpret ways significant accord needs attachments goals commitments plans ends desires etc
Thinking involves symbolic semiotic mediation ideas data form concepts engage problem solving reasoning making decisions
Words refer similar concepts processes include deliberation cognition ideation discourse imagination
Thinking sometimes described higher cognitive function analysis thinking processes part cognitive psychology
It also deeply connected capacity make use tools understand cause effect recognize patterns significance comprehend disclose unique contexts experience activity respond world meaningful way
Memory ability preserve retain subsequently recall knowledge information experience
Although memory traditionally persistent theme philosophy late nineteenth early twentieth centuries also saw study memory emerge subject inquiry within paradigms cognitive psychology
In recent decades become one pillars new branch science called cognitive neuroscience marriage cognitive psychology neuroscience
Imagination activity generating evoking novel situations images ideas qualia mind
It characteristically subjective activity rather direct passive experience
The term technically used psychology process reviving mind percepts objects formerly given sense perception
Since use term conflicts ordinary language psychologists preferred describe process imaging imagery speak reproductive opposed productive constructive imagination
Things imagined said seen mind eye
Among many practical functions imagination ability project possible futures histories see things another perspective change way something perceived including make decisions respond enact imagined

Phenomenal consciousness usually consciousness something something property known intentionality philosophy mind
Mental content Mental contents items thought mind capable formed manipulated mental processes faculties
Examples include thoughts concepts memories emotions percepts intentions
Philosophical theories mental content include internalism externalism representationalism intentionality
Memetics Memetics theory mental content based analogy Darwinian evolution originated Richard Dawkins Douglas Hofstadter
It evolutionary model cultural information transfer
A meme analogous gene idea belief pattern behaviour etc
hosted one individual minds reproduce mind mind
Thus would otherwise regarded one individual influencing another adopt belief seen memetically meme reproducing
Relation brain In animals brain encephalon Greek head control center central nervous system responsible thought
In animals brain located head protected skull close primary sensory apparatus vision hearing equilibrioception taste olfaction
While vertebrates brain invertebrates either centralized brain collections individual ganglia
Primitive animals sponges brain
Brains extremely complex
For example human brain contains around billion neurons linked many others Understanding relationship brain mind mind body problem one central issues history philosophy challenging problem philosophically scientifically
There three major philosophical schools thought concerning answer dualism materialism idealism
Dualism holds mind exists independently brain materialism holds mental phenomena identical neuronal phenomena idealism holds mental phenomena exist Through history many philosophers found inconceivable cognition could implemented physical substance brain tissue neurons synapses
Descartes thought extensively mind brain relationships found possible explain reflexes simple behaviors mechanistic terms although believe complex thought language particular could explained reference physical brain alone The straightforward scientific evidence strong relationship physical brain matter mind impact physical alterations brain mind traumatic brain injury psychoactive drug use
Philosopher Patricia Churchland notes drug mind interaction indicates intimate connection brain mind In addition philosophical questions relationship mind brain involves number scientific questions including understanding relationship mental activity brain activity exact mechanisms drugs influence cognition neural correlates consciousness
Theoretical approaches explain mind emerges brain include connectionism computationalism Bayesian brain
Evolutionary history human mind The evolution human intelligence refers several theories aim describe human intelligence evolved relation evolution human brain origin language The timeline human evolution spans million years separation genus Pan emergence behavioral modernity years ago
Of timeline first million years concern Sahelanthropus following million concern Australopithecus final million span history actual Homo species Paleolithic
Many traits human intelligence empathy theory mind mourning ritual use symbols tools already apparent great apes although lesser sophistication humans
There debate supporters idea sudden emergence intelligence Great leap forward gradual continuum hypothesis
Theories evolution intelligence include Robin Dunbar social brain hypothesis Geoffrey Miller sexual selection hypothesis concerning Sexual selection human evolution The ecological dominance social competition EDSC explained Mark V Flinn David C Geary Carol V Ward based mainly work Richard D Alexander
The idea intelligence signal good health resistance disease
The Group selection theory contends organism characteristics provide benefits group clan tribe larger population evolve despite individual disadvantages cited
The idea intelligence connected nutrition thereby status
A higher IQ could signal individual comes lives physical social environment nutrition levels high vice versa
Philosophy mind Philosophy mind branch philosophy studies nature mind mental events mental functions mental properties consciousness relationship physical body
The mind body problem e
relationship mind body commonly seen central issue philosophy mind although issues concerning nature mind involve relation physical body
José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado writes In present popular usage soul mind clearly differentiated people less consciously still feel soul perhaps mind may enter leave body independent entities
Dualism monism two major schools thought attempt resolve mind body problem
Dualism position mind body way separate
It traced back Plato Aristotle Nyaya Samkhya Yoga schools Hindu philosophy precisely formulated René Descartes th century
Substance dualists argue mind independently existing substance whereas Property dualists maintain mind group independent properties emerge cannot reduced brain distinct substance The th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested subjective experience activity e
mind cannot made sense terms Cartesian substances bear properties whether mind thought distinct separate kind substance
This nature subjective qualitative experience incoherent terms semantically incommensurable concept substances bear properties
This fundamentally ontological argument The philosopher cognitive science Daniel Dennett example argues thing narrative center called mind instead simply collection sensory inputs outputs different kinds software running parallel
Psychologist B F Skinner argued mind explanatory fiction diverts attention environmental causes behavior considered mind black box thought mental processes may better conceived forms covert verbal behavior Philosopher David Chalmers argued third person approach uncovering mind consciousness effective looking brains observing human conduct first person approach necessary
Such first person perspective indicates mind must conceptualized something distinct brain
The mind also described manifesting moment moment one thought moment time fast flowing stream sense impressions mental phenomena constantly changing
Mind body perspectives Monism position mind body physiologically ontologically distinct kinds entities
This view first advocated Western Philosophy Parmenides th Century BC later espoused th Century rationalist Baruch Spinoza
According Spinoza dual aspect theory mind body two aspects underlying reality variously described Nature God
Physicalists argue entities postulated physical theory exist mind eventually explained terms entities physical theory continues evolve
Idealists maintain mind exists external world either mental illusion created mind
Neutral monists adhere position perceived things world regarded either physical mental depending whether one interested relationship things world relationship perceiver
For example red spot wall physical dependence wall pigment made mental far perceived redness depends workings visual system
Unlike dual aspect theory neutral monism posit fundamental substance mind body aspects The common monisms th st centuries variations physicalism positions include behaviorism type identity theory anomalous monism functionalism Many modern philosophers mind adopt either reductive non reductive physicalist position maintaining different ways mind something separate body
These approaches particularly influential sciences e g
fields sociobiology computer science evolutionary psychology various neurosciences
Other philosophers however adopt non physicalist position challenges notion mind purely physical construct
Reductive physicalists assert mental states properties eventually explained scientific accounts physiological processes states
Non reductive physicalists argue although brain mind predicates vocabulary used mental descriptions explanations indispensable cannot reduced language lower level explanations physical science Continued progress neuroscience helped clarify many issues findings taken many support physicalists assertions
Nevertheless knowledge incomplete modern philosophers mind continue discuss subjective qualia intentional mental states naturally explained
Then course problem Quantum Mechanics best understood form perspectivism
Scientific study Neuroscience Neuroscience studies nervous system physical basis mind
At systems level neuroscientists investigate biological neural networks form physiologically interact produce mental functions content reflexes multisensory integration motor coordination circadian rhythms emotional responses learning memory
The underlying physical basis learning memory likely dynamic changes gene expression occur brain neurons
Such expression changes introduced epigenetic mechanisms
Epigenetic regulation gene expression ordinarily involves chemical modification DNA DNA associated histone proteins
Such chemical modifications cause long lasting changes gene expression
Epigenetic mechanisms employed learning memory include methylation demethylation neuronal DNA well methylation acetylation deacetylation neuronal histone proteins
At larger scale efforts computational neuroscience developed large scale models simulate simple functioning brains
As models include thalamus basal ganglia prefrontal cortex motor cortex occipital cortex consequentially simulated brains learn respond visual stimuli coordinate motor responses form short term memories learn respond patterns
Currently researchers aim program hippocampus limbic system hypothetically imbuing simulated mind long term memory crude emotions By contrast affective neuroscience studies neural mechanisms personality emotion mood primarily experimental tasks
Cognitive Science Cognitive science examines mental functions give rise information processing termed cognition
These include perception attention working memory long term memory producing understanding language learning reasoning problem solving decision making
Cognitive science seeks understand thinking terms representational structures mind computational procedures operate structures
Psychology Psychology scientific study human behavior mental functioning experience
As academic applied discipline Psychology involves scientific study mental processes perception cognition emotion personality well environmental influences social cultural influences interpersonal relationships order devise theories human behavior
Psychological patterns understood low cost ways information processing
Psychology also refers application knowledge various spheres human activity including problems individuals daily lives treatment mental health problems
Psychology differs social sciences e g
anthropology economics political science sociology due focus experimentation scale individual individuals small groups opposed large groups institutions societies
Historically psychology differed biology neuroscience primarily concerned mind rather brain
Modern psychological science incorporates physiological neurological processes conceptions perception cognition behaviour mental disorders
Mental health By analogy health body one speak metaphorically state health mind mental health
Merriam Webster defines mental health A state emotional psychological well individual able use cognitive emotional capabilities function society meet ordinary demands everyday life
According World Health Organization WHO one official definition mental health
Cultural differences subjective assessments competing professional theories affect mental health defined
In general experts agree mental health mental disorder opposites
In words absence recognized mental disorder necessarily indicator mental health
One way think mental health looking effectively successfully person functions
Feeling capable competent able handle normal levels stress maintaining satisfying relationships leading independent life able bounce back recover difficult situations signs mental health
Psychotherapy interpersonal relational intervention used trained psychotherapists aid clients problems living
This usually includes increasing individual sense well reducing subjective discomforting experience
Psychotherapists employ range techniques based experiential relationship building dialogue communication behavior change designed improve mental health client patient improve group relationships family
Most forms psychotherapy use spoken conversation though also use various forms communication written word art drama narrative story therapeutic touch
Psychotherapy occurs within structured encounter trained therapist client
Purposeful theoretically based psychotherapy began th century psychoanalysis since scores approaches developed continue created
Non human minds Animal intelligence Animal cognition cognitive ethology title given modern approach mental capacities animals
It developed comparative psychology also strongly influenced approach ethology behavioral ecology evolutionary psychology
Much used considered title animal intelligence thought heading
Animal language acquisition attempting discern understand degree animal cognition revealed linguistics related study controversial among cognitive linguists
Artificial intelligence In Alan M Turing published Computing machinery intelligence Mind proposed machines could tested intelligence using questions answers
This process named Turing Test
The term Artificial Intelligence AI first used John McCarthy considered mean science engineering making intelligent machines
It also refer intelligence exhibited artificial man made non natural manufactured entity
AI studied overlapping fields computer science psychology neuroscience engineering dealing intelligent behavior learning adaptation usually developed using customized machines computers
Research AI concerned producing machines automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior
Examples include control planning scheduling ability answer diagnostic consumer questions handwriting natural language speech facial recognition
As study AI also become engineering discipline focused providing solutions real life problems knowledge mining software applications strategy games like computer chess video games
One biggest limitations AI domain actual machine comprehension
Consequentially natural language understanding connectionism behavior neural networks investigated areas active research development
The debate nature mind relevant development artificial intelligence
If mind indeed thing separate higher functioning brain hypothetically would much difficult recreate within machine possible
If hand mind aggregated functions brain possible create machine recognisable mind though possibly computers much different today simple virtue fact machine already exists form human brain
In religion Many religions associate spiritual qualities human mind
These often tightly connected mythology ideas afterlife
The Indian philosopher sage Sri Aurobindo attempted unite Eastern Western psychological traditions integral psychology many philosophers New religious movements
Judaism teaches moach shalit al halev mind rules heart
Humans approach Divine intellectually learning behaving according Divine Will enclothed Torah use deep logical understanding elicit guide emotional arousal prayer
Christianity tended see mind distinct soul Greek nous sometimes distinguished spirit
Western esoteric traditions sometimes refer mental body exists plane physical
Hinduism various philosophical schools debated whether human soul Sanskrit atman distinct identical Brahman divine reality
Taoism sees human contiguous natural forces mind separate body
Confucianism sees mind like body inherently perfectible
Buddhism Buddhist teachings explain moment moment manifestation mind stream
The components make mind known five aggregates e material form feelings perception volition sensory consciousness arise pass away continuously
The arising passing aggregates present moment described influenced five causal laws biological laws psychological laws physical laws volitional laws universal laws
The Buddhist practice mindfulness involves attending constantly changing mind stream
According Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti mind two fundamental qualities clarity cognizes
If something two qualities cannot validly called mind
Clarity refers fact mind color shape size location weight physical characteristic cognizes functions know perceive objects
Knowing refers fact mind aware contents experience order exist mind must cognizing object
You cannot mind whose function cognize object existing without cognizing object
Mind Buddhism also described space like illusion like
Mind space like sense physically obstructive
It qualities would prevent existing
In Mahayana Buddhism mind illusion like sense empty inherent existence
This mean exist means exists manner counter ordinary way misperceiving phenomena exist according Buddhism
When mind cognized properly without misperceiving mode existence appears exist like illusion
There big difference however space illusion space like illusion like
Mind composed space shares descriptive similarities space
Mind illusion shares descriptive qualities illusions
Buddhism posits inherent unchanging identity Inherent I Inherent Me phenomena Ultimate self inherent self Atman Soul Self essence Jiva Ishvara humanness essence etc
experiencer experiences agent actions
In words human beings consist merely body mind nothing extra
Within body part set parts person
Similarly within mind part set parts person
A human merely consists five aggregates skandhas nothing else
In way mind validly conceptually labelled onto mere experience clarity knowing
There something separate apart clarity knowing Awareness Buddhism
Mind part experience sixth sense door validly referred mind concept term mind
There also objects mind experience somewhere
There third thing called awareness exists aware contents mind mind cognizes
There five senses arising mere experience shapes colors components smell components taste components sound components touch mind sixth institution means expressly third thing called awareness third thing called experiencer aware experience
This awareness deeply related self judge experience craving aversion
Clearly experience arises known mind third thing calls Sati real experiencer experience sits apart experience aware experience levels
Maha Sathipatthana Sutta
Body Sensations Changes body mind
Mind Contents mind
Changes body mind
To aware four levels one needs cultivate equanimity toward Craving Aversion
This Called Vipassana different way reacting Craving Aversion
This state aware equanimous complete experience
This way Buddhism regards mind ultimate nature minds persons
Mortality mind Due mind body problem lot interest debate surrounds question happens one conscious mind one body dies
During brain death brain function permanently ceases
According neuroscientific views see processes physical basis mental phenomena mind fails survive brain death ceases exist
This permanent loss consciousness death sometimes called eternal oblivion
The belief spiritual incorporeal component soul exists preserved death described term afterlife
In pseudoscience Parapsychology Parapsychology study certain types paranormal phenomena phenomena appear paranormal scientific basis instance precognition telekinesis telepathy
The term based Greek para beside beyond psyche soul mind logos account explanation coined psychologist Max Dessoir
J B Rhine tried popularize parapsychology using fraudulent techniques replacement earlier term psychical research shift methodologies brought experimental methods study psychic phenomena
Parapsychology accepted among scientific community science psychic abilities demonstrated exist

In artificial intelligence knowledge based agents draw pool logical sentences infer conclusions world
At knowledge level need specify agent knows goals logical abstraction separate details implementation
This notion knowledge level first introduced Allen Newell way rationalize agent behavior
The agent takes actions based knowledge possesses attempt reach specific goals
It chooses actions according principle rationality
Beneath knowledge level resides symbol level
Whereas knowledge level world oriented namely concerns environment agent operates symbol level system oriented includes mechanisms agent available operate
The knowledge level rationalizes agent behavior symbol level mechanizes agent behavior
For example computer program knowledge level consists information contained data structures uses perform certain actions
The symbol level consists program algorithms data structures

The Zeuthen strategy negotiation strategy used artificial agents
Its purpose measure willingness risk conflict
An agent willing risk conflict much lose case negotiation fails
In contrast agent less willing risk conflict lose
The value deal expressed utility
An agent much lose difference utility current proposal conflict deal high
When agents use monotonic concession protocol Zeuthen strategy leads agree upon deal negotiation set
This set consists conflict free deals individually rational Pareto optimal conflict deal maximizes Nash product
The strategy introduced Danish economist Frederik Zeuthen
Three key questions The Zeuthen strategy answers three open questions arise using monotonic concession protocol namely Which deal proposed first
On given round concede
In case concession much agent concede The answer first question agent start preferred deal deal highest utility agent
The second answer agent smallest value Risk concedes agent lowest utility conflict deal profits avoiding conflict
To third question Zeuthen strategy suggests conceding agent concede enough raise value Risk agent
This prevents conceding agent concede next round
Risk Risk U δ U δ U δ j U δ otherwise displaystyle text Risk begin cases U_ delta frac U_ delta U_ delta j U_ delta text otherwise end cases Risk measurement agent willingness risk conflict
The risk function formalizes notion agent willingness risk conflict ratio utility agent would lose accepting agent proposal utility agent would lose causing conflict
Agent said using rational negotiation strategy step agent sticks last proposal Risk Risk j
Sufficient concession If agent makes sufficient concession next step assuming agent j using rational negotiation strategy agent j concede next step must step
The set sufficient concessions agent step denoted SC
Minimal sufficient concession δ arg max δ S C A U A δ displaystyle delta arg max _ delta SC A U_ A delta minimal sufficient concession agent A step Agent A begins negotiation proposing δ A arg max δ N S U A δ displaystyle delta A arg max _ delta NS U_ A delta make minimal sufficient concession step Risk A Risk B
Theorem If agents using Zeuthen strategies agree δ arg max δ N S π δ displaystyle delta arg max _ delta NS pi delta deal maximizes Nash product Proof Let δA δ A
Let δB δ B
According Zeuthen strategy agent A concede step displaystyle R k A R k B
displaystyle Risk A leq Risk B
That U A δ A U A δ B U A δ A U B δ B U B δ A U B δ B displaystyle frac U_ A delta _ A U_ A delta _ B U_ A delta _ A leq frac U_ B delta _ B U_ B delta _ A U_ B delta _ B U B δ B U A δ A U A δ B U A δ A U B δ B U B δ A displaystyle U_ B delta _ B U_ A delta _ A U_ A delta _ B leq U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ B U_ B delta _ A U A δ A U B δ B U A δ B U B δ B U A δ A U B δ B U A δ A U B δ A displaystyle U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ B U_ A delta _ B U_ B delta _ B leq U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ B U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ A U A δ B U B δ B U A δ A U B δ A displaystyle U_ A delta _ B U_ B delta _ B leq U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ A U A δ A U B δ A U A δ B U B δ B displaystyle U_ A delta _ A U_ B delta _ A leq U_ A delta _ B U_ B delta _ B π δ A π δ B displaystyle pi delta _ A leq pi delta _ B Thus Agent A concede δ A displaystyle delta _ A yield larger product utilities
Therefore Zeuthen strategy guarantees final agreement maximizes Nash Product

Deepfake pornography simply fake pornography type synthetic porn generated using deepfake technology
Many deepfakes internet feature pornography people often female celebrities whose likeness typically used without consent
History Deepfake pornography prominently surfaced Internet particularly Reddit
The first one captured attention Daisy Ridley deepfake featured several articles
Other prominent pornographic deepfakes various celebrities In December Samantha Cole published article r deepfakes Vice drew first mainstream attention deepfakes shared online communities
Six weeks later Cole wrote follow article large increase AI assisted fake pornography
Since Samantha Cole Vice published series articles covering news surrounding deepfake pornography Since multiple social media outlets banned made efforts restrict deepfake pornography
Most notably r deepfakes subreddit Reddit banned February due policy violation involuntary pornography
In month representatives Twitter stated would suspend accounts suspected posting non consensual deepfake content Scarlett Johansson frequent subject deepfake porn spoke publicly subject The Washington Post December
In prepared statement expressed despite concerns would attempt remove deepfakes due belief affect public image differing laws across countries nature internet culture make attempt remove deepfakes lost cause
While celebrities like protected fame however believes deepfakes pose grave threat women lesser prominence could reputations damaged depiction involuntary deepfake pornography revenge porn In June downloadable Windows Linux application called DeepNude released used neural networks specifically generative adversarial networks remove clothing images women
The app paid unpaid version paid version costing
On June creators removed application refunded consumers
Efforts limit deepfake pornography On January st Gfycat began removing deepfakes site In February r deepfakes banned Reddit sharing involuntary pornography
Other websites also banned use deepfakes involuntary pornography including social media platform Twitter pornography site Pornhub
However websites yet banned Deepfake content including chan chan Also February Pornhub said would ban deepfake videos website considered non consensual content violates terms service
They also stated previously Mashable take content flagged deepfakes
Writers Motherboard Buzzfeed News reported searching deepfakes Pornhub still returned multiple recent deepfake videos Chat site Discord taken action deepfakes past taken general stance deepfakes
In September Google added involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery ban list allowing anyone request block results showing fake nudes

In regulation algorithms particularly artificial intelligence subfield machine learning right explanation right explanation right given explanation output algorithm
Such rights primarily refer individual rights given explanation decisions significantly affect individual particularly legally financially
For example person applies loan denied may ask explanation could Credit bureau X reports declared bankruptcy last year main factor considering likely default thus give loan applied
Some legal rights already exist scope general right explanation matter ongoing debate
Examples Credit score United States Credit score United States generally credit actions well established right explanation
Under Equal Credit Opportunity Act Regulation B Code Federal Regulations Title Chapter X Part creditors required notify applicants action taken certain circumstances notifications must provide specific reasons detailed b Statement specific reasons
The statement reasons adverse action required paragraph section must specific indicate principal reason adverse action
Statements adverse action based creditor internal standards policies applicant joint applicant similar party failed achieve qualifying score creditor credit scoring system insufficient
The official interpretation section details types statements acceptable
Credit agencies data analysis firms FICO comply regulation providing list reasons generally per interpretation regulations consisting numeric reason code identifier associated explanation identifying main factors affecting credit score
An example might Balances bankcard revolving accounts high compared credit limits European Union The European Union General Data Protection Regulation enacted taking effect extends automated decision making rights Data Protection Directive provide legally disputed form right explanation stated Recital data subject right obtain explanation decision reached

In case processing subject suitable safeguards include specific information data subject right obtain human intervention express point view obtain explanation decision reached assessment challenge decision
However extent regulations provide right explanation heavily debated
There two main strands criticism
There significant legal issues right found Article recitals binding right explanation mentioned binding articles text removed legislative process
In addition significant restrictions types automated decisions covered must solely based automated processing legal similarly significant effects significantly limits range automated systems decisions right would apply
In particular right unlikely apply many cases algorithmic controversy picked media A second potential source right pointed Article right access data subject
This restates similar provision Data Protection Directive allowing data subject access meaningful information logic involved significant solely automated decision making found Article
Yet suffers alleged challenges relate timing right drawn upon well practical challenges mean may binding many cases public concern
France In France Loi pour une République numérique Digital Republic Act loi numérique amends country administrative code introduce new provision explanation decisions made public sector bodies individuals
It notes decision taken basis algorithmic treatment rules define treatment principal characteristics must communicated citizen upon request exclusion e g
national security defence
These include following degree mode contribution algorithmic processing decision making data processed source treatment parameters appropriate weighting applied situation person concerned operations carried treatment Scholars noted right limited administrative decisions goes beyond GDPR right explicitly apply decision support rather decisions solely based automated processing well provides framework explaining specific decisions
Indeed GDPR automated decision making rights European Union one places right explanation sought within find origins French law late
Criticism Some argue right explanation best unnecessary worst harmful threatens stifle innovation
Specific criticisms include favoring human decisions machine decisions redundant existing laws focusing process outcome More fundamentally many algorithms used machine learning easily explainable
For example output deep neural network depends many layers computations connected complex way one input computation may dominant factor
The field Explainable AI seeks provide better explanations existing algorithms algorithms easily explainable young active field Similarly human decisions often cannot easily explained may based intuition gut feeling hard put words
Some would argue machines required meet higher standard humans

A Gödel machine hypothetical self improving computer program solves problems optimal way
It uses recursive self improvement protocol rewrites code prove new code provides better strategy
The machine invented Jürgen Schmidhuber first proposed named Kurt Gödel inspired mathematical theories The Gödel machine often discussed dealing issues meta learning also known learning learn
Applications include automating human design decisions transfer knowledge multiple related tasks may lead design robust general learning architectures
Though theoretically possible full implementation created The Gödel machine often compared Marcus Hutter AIXItl another formal specification artificial general intelligence
Schmidhuber points Gödel machine could start implementing AIXItl initial sub program self modify finds proof another algorithm search code better
Limitations Traditional problems solved computer require one input provide output
Computers sort initial algorithm hardwired
This take account dynamic natural environment thus goal Gödel machine overcome
The Gödel machine limitations however
Any formal system encompasses arithmetic either flawed allows unprovable true statements
Hence even Gödel machine unlimited computational resources must ignore self improvements whose effectiveness cannot prove
Variables interest There three variables particularly useful run time Gödel machine
At time displaystyle variable time displaystyle text time binary equivalent displaystyle
This incremented steadily throughout run time machine Any input meant Gödel machine natural environment stored variable x displaystyle x
It likely case x displaystyle x hold different values different values variable time displaystyle text time The outputs Gödel machine stored variable displaystyle displaystyle would output bit string time displaystyle At given time displaystyle T displaystyle leq leq T goal maximize future success utility
A typical utility function follows pattern u E n v S E R displaystyle u mathrm Env S times E rightarrow mathbb R u E n v E μ τ time T r τ E n v displaystyle u mathrm Env E_ mu Bigg sum _ tau text time T r tau mid mathrm Env Bigg r displaystyle r real valued reward input encoded within displaystyle time displaystyle E μ displaystyle E_ mu cdot mid cdot denotes conditional expectation operator respect possibly unknown distribution μ displaystyle mu set M displaystyle M possible distributions M displaystyle M reflects whatever known possibly probabilistic reactions environment mentioned time time displaystyle text time operatorname time function state displaystyle uniquely identifies current cycle
Note take account possibility extending expected lifespan appropriate actions
Instructions used proof techniques The nature six proof modifying instructions makes impossible insert incorrect theorem proof thus trivializing proof verification
get axiom n Appends n th axiom theorem current theorem sequence
Below initial axiom scheme Hardware Axioms formally specify components machine could change one cycle next
Reward Axioms define computational cost hardware instruction physical cost output actions
Related Axioms also define lifetime Gödel machine scalar quantities representing rewards costs
Environment Axioms restrict way new inputs x produced environment based previous sequences inputs
Uncertainty Axioms String Manipulation Axioms standard axioms arithmetic calculus probability theory string manipulation allow construction proofs related future variable values within Gödel machine
Initial State Axioms contain information reconstruct parts initial state
Utility Axioms describe overall goal form utility function u apply rule k n Takes index k inference rule Modus tollens Modus ponens attempts apply two previously proved theorems n The resulting theorem added proof
delete theorem Deletes theorem stored index current proof
This helps mitigate storage constraints caused redundant unnecessary theorems
Deleted theorems longer referenced apply rule function
set switchprog n Replaces switchprog S pm n provided non empty substring S p check Verifies whether goal proof search reached
A target theorem states given current axiomatized utility function u Item f utility switch p current switchprog would higher utility continuing execution p would keep searching alternative switchprogs
This demonstrated following description decoded check function Gödel Machine D K A pore u pore κ N T π M A displaystyle D_ KA frac d_ text pore u frac d_ text pore sqrt frac kappa NT pi M_ A state theorem n Takes two arguments n attempts convert contents Sm n theorem
Example applications Time limited NP hard optimization The initial input Gödel machine representation connected graph large number nodes linked edges various lengths
Within given time T find cyclic path connecting nodes
The real valued reward occur time T It equals divided length best path found far none found
There inputs
The product maximizing expected reward find shortest path findable within limited time given initial bias
Fast theorem proving Prove disprove quickly possible even integer sum two primes Goldbach conjecture
The reward time required produce verify first proof
Maximizing expected reward bounded resources A cognitive robot needs least liter gasoline per hour interacts partially unknown environment trying find hidden limited gasoline depots occasionally refuel tank
It rewarded proportion lifetime dies years soon tank empty falls cliff
The probabilistic environmental reactions initially unknown assumed sampled axiomatized Speed Prior according hard compute environmental reactions unlikely
This permits computable strategy making near optimal predictions
One product maximizing expected reward maximize expected lifetime

Such neural systems embodied machines mechanic forms physical actuation
This includes robots prosthetic wearable systems also smaller scale micro machines larger scales furniture infrastructures
Neurorobotics branch neuroscience robotics deals study application science technology embodied autonomous neural systems like brain inspired algorithms
At core neurorobotics based idea brain embodied body embedded environment
Therefore neurorobots required function real world opposed simulated environment Beyond brain inspired algorithms robots neurorobotics may also involve design brain controlled robot systems
Introduction Neurorobotics represents two front approach study intelligence
Neuroscience attempts discern intelligence consists works investigating intelligent biological systems study artificial intelligence attempts recreate intelligence non biological artificial means
Neurorobotics overlap two biologically inspired theories tested grounded environment physical implementation said model
The successes failures neurorobot model built provide evidence refute support theory give insight future study
Major classes neurorobotic models Neurorobots divided various major classes based robot purpose
Each class designed implement specific mechanism interest study
Common types neurorobots used study motor control memory action selection perception
Locomotion motor control Neurorobots often used study motor feedback control systems proved merit developing controllers robots
Locomotion modeled number neurologically inspired theories action motor systems
Locomotion control mimicked using models central pattern generators clumps neurons capable driving repetitive behavior make four legged walking robots
Other groups expanded idea combining rudimentary control systems hierarchical set simple autonomous systems
These systems formulate complex movements combination rudimentary subsets
This theory motor action based organization cortical columns progressively integrate simple sensory input complex afferent signals complex motor programs simple controls muscle fiber efferent signals forming similar hierarchical structure
Another method motor control uses learned error correction predictive controls form sort simulated muscle memory
In model awkward random error prone movements corrected using error feedback produce smooth accurate movements time
The controller learns create correct control signal predicting error
Using ideas robots designed learn produce adaptive arm movements avoid obstacles course
Learning memory systems Robots designed test theories animal memory systems
Many studies currently examine memory system rats particularly rat hippocampus dealing place cells fire specific location learned
Systems modeled rat hippocampus generally able learn mental maps environment including recognizing landmarks associating behaviors allowing predict upcoming obstacles landmarks Another study produced robot based proposed learning paradigm barn owls orientation localization based primarily auditory also visual stimuli
The hypothesized method involves synaptic plasticity neuromodulation mostly chemical effect reward neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin affect firing sensitivity neuron sharper
The robot used study adequately matched behavior barn owls
Furthermore close interaction motor output auditory feedback proved vital learning process supporting active sensing theories involved many learning models Neurorobots studies presented simple mazes patterns learn
Some problems presented neurorobot include recognition symbols colors patterns execute simple actions based pattern
In case barn owl simulation robot determine location direction navigate environment
Action selection value systems Action selection studies deal negative positive weighting action outcome
Neurorobots used study simple ethical interactions classical thought experiment people life raft hold someone must leave boat save rest
However neurorobots used study action selection contend much simpler persuasions self preservation perpetuation population robots study
These neurorobots modeled neuromodulation synapses encourage circuits positive results
In biological systems neurotransmitters dopamine acetylcholine positively reinforce neural signals beneficial
One study interaction involved robot Darwin VII used visual auditory simulated taste input eat conductive metal blocks
The arbitrarily chosen good blocks striped pattern bad blocks circular shape
The taste sense simulated conductivity blocks
The robot positive negative feedbacks taste based level conductivity
The researchers observed robot see learned action selection behaviors based inputs
Other studies used herds small robots feed batteries strewn room communicate findings robots
Sensory perception Neurorobots also used study sensory perception particularly vision
These primarily systems result embedding neural models sensory pathways automatas
This approach gives exposure sensory signals occur behavior also enables realistic assessment degree robustness neural model
It well known changes sensory signals produced motor activity provide useful perceptual cues used extensively organisms
For example researchers used depth information emerges replication human head eye movements establish robust representations visual scene
Biological robots Biological robots officially neurorobots neurologically inspired AI systems actual neuron tissue wired robot
This employs use cultured neural networks study brain development neural interactions
These typically consist neural culture raised multielectrode array MEA capable recording neural activity stimulating tissue
In cases MEA connected computer presents simulated environment brain tissue translates brain activity actions simulation well providing sensory feedback
The ability record neural activity gives researchers window brain albeit simple use learn number issues neurorobots used
An area concern biological robots ethics
Many questions raised treat experiments
Seemingly important question consciousness whether rat brain experiences
This discussion boils many theories consciousness See Hybrot consciousness
Implications neuroscience Neuroscientists benefit neurorobotics provides blank slate test various possible methods brain function controlled testable environment
Furthermore robots simplified versions systems emulate specific allowing direct testing issue hand
They also benefit accessible times much difficult monitor even large portions brain animal active let alone individual neurons
With subject neuroscience growing numerous neural treatments emerged pharmaceuticals neural rehabilitation
Progress dependent intricate understanding brain exactly functions
It difficult study brain especially humans due danger associated cranial surgeries
Therefore use technology fill void testable subjects vital
Neurorobots accomplish exactly improving range tests experiments performed study neural processes

A handwriting recognition system handles formatting performs correct segmentation characters finds plausible words
Off line recognition Off line handwriting recognition involves automatic conversion text image letter codes usable within computer text processing applications
The data obtained form regarded static representation handwriting
Off line handwriting recognition comparatively difficult different people different handwriting styles
And today OCR engines primarily focused machine printed text ICR hand printed written capital letters text
Traditional techniques Character extraction Off line character recognition often involves scanning form document written sometime past
This means individual characters contained scanned image need extracted
Tools exist capable performing step
However several common imperfections step
The common characters connected returned single sub image containing characters
This causes major problem recognition stage
Yet many algorithms available reduce risk connected characters
Character recognition After extraction individual characters occurs recognition engine used identify corresponding computer character
Several different recognition techniques currently available
Feature extraction Feature extraction works similar fashion neural network recognizers
However programmers must manually determine properties feel important
This approach gives recognizer control properties used identification
Yet system using approach requires substantially development time neural network properties learned automatically
Modern techniques Where traditional techniques focus segmenting individual characters recognition modern techniques focus recognizing characters segmented line text
Particularly focus machine learning techniques able learn visual features avoiding limiting feature engineering previously used
State art methods use convolutional networks extract visual features several overlapping windows text line image RNN uses produce character probabilities
On line recognition On line handwriting recognition involves automatic conversion text written special digitizer PDA sensor picks pen tip movements well pen pen switching

The Kuwahara filter non linear smoothing filter used image processing adaptive noise reduction
Most filters used image smoothing linear low pass filters effectively reduce noise also blur edges
However Kuwahara filter able apply smoothing image preserving edges
It named Michiyoshi Kuwahara Ph D worked Kyoto Osaka Sangyo Universities Japan developing early medical imaging dynamic heart muscle
The Kuwahara Operator Suppose I x displaystyle I x grey scale image take square window size displaystyle centered around point x displaystyle x image
This square divided four smaller square regions Q displaystyle Q_ cdots Q x x x x x x x x x displaystyle Q_ x begin cases left x x right times left right mbox left x x right times left right mbox left x x right times left right mbox left x x right times left right mbox end cases displaystyle times cartesian product
It must noted pixels located borders two regions belong regions slight overlap subregions
The arithmetic mean x displaystyle m_ x standard deviation σ x displaystyle sigma _ x four regions centered around pixel x calculated used determine value central pixel
The output Kuwahara filter Φ x displaystyle Phi x point x displaystyle x given Φ x x textstyle Phi x m_ x r g min j σ j x displaystyle operatorname arg min _ j sigma _ j x
This means central pixel take mean value area homogenous
The location pixel relation edge plays great role determining region greater standard deviation
If example pixel located dark side edge probably take mean value dark region
On hand pixel lighter side edge probably take light value
On event pixel located edge take value smooth least textured region
The fact filter takes account homogeneity regions ensures preserve edges using mean creates blurring effect
Similarly Median filter Kuwahara filter uses sliding window approach access every pixel image
The size window chosen advance may vary depending desired level blur final image
Bigger windows typically result creation abstract images whereas small windows produce images retain detail
Typically windows chose square sides odd number pixels symmetry
However variations Kuwahara filter use rectangular windows
Additionally subregions need overlap size long cover window
Color Images For color images filter performed applying filter RGB channel separately recombining three filtered color channels form filtered RGB image
The main problem quadrants different standard deviations channels
For example upper left quadrant may lowest standard deviation red channel lower right quadrant may lowest standard deviation green channel
This situation would result color central pixel determined different regions might result color artifacts blurrier edges
To overcome problem color images slightly modified Kuwahara filter must used
The image first converted another color space HSV color model
The modified filter operates brightness channel Value coordinate HSV model
The variance brightness quadrant calculated determine quadrant final filtered color taken
The filter produce output channel correspond mean channel quadrant lowest standard deviation brightness
This ensures one region determine RGB values central pixel
Applications Originally Kuwahara filter proposed use processing RI angiocardiographic images cardiovascular system
The fact edges preserved smoothing makes especially useful feature extraction segmentation explains used medical imaging
The Kuwahara filter however also finds many applications artistic imaging fine art photography due ability remove textures sharpen edges photographs
The level abstraction helps create desirable painting like effect artistic photographs especially case colored image version filter
These applications known great success encouraged similar research field image processing arts
Although vast majority applications field image processing cases use modifications Kuwahara filter machine learning tasks clustering The Kuwahara filter implemented CVIPtools
Drawbacks restrictions The Kuwahara filter despite capabilities edge preservation certain drawbacks
At first glance noticeable Kuwahara filter take account case two regions equal standard deviations
This often case real images since rather hard find two regions exactly standard deviation due noise always present
In cases two regions similar standard deviations value center pixel could decided random noise regions
Again would problem regions mean
However unusual regions different means standard deviation
This makes Kuwahara filter susceptible noise
Different ways proposed dealing issue one set value center pixel displaystyle frac m_ m_ cases standard deviation two regions differ certain value D displaystyle D
The Kuwahara filter also known create block artifacts images especially regions image highly textured
These blocks disrupt smoothness image considered negative effect aesthetics image
This phenomenon occurs due division window square regions
A way overcome effect take windows rectangular e
circular windows separate non rectangular regions
There also approaches filter adapts window depending input image
Extensions Kuwahara filter The success Kuwahara filter spurred increase development edge enhancing smoothing filters
Several variations proposed similar use attempt deal drawbacks original Kuwahara filter
The Generalized Kuwahara filter proposed P Bakker considers several windows contain fixed pixel
Each window assigned estimate confidence value
The value fixed pixel takes value estimate window highest confidence
This filter characterized ambiguity presence noise manages eliminate block artifacts
The Mean Least Variance MLV filter proposed M A
Schulze also produces edge enhancing smoothing results images
Similarly Kuwahara filter assumes window size displaystyle times instead searching amongst four subregions size displaystyle times one minimum variance searches amongst possible displaystyle times subregions
This means central pixel window assigned mean one subregion possible displaystyle smallest variance
A recent attempt edge enhancing smoothing also proposed J E Kyprianidis
The filter output weighed sum local averages weight given averages homogenous regions

Pattern theory formulated Ulf Grenander mathematical formalism describe knowledge world patterns
It differs approaches artificial intelligence begin prescribing algorithms machinery recognize classify patterns rather prescribes vocabulary articulate recast pattern concepts precise language
Broad mathematical coverage Pattern Theory spans algebra statistics well local topological global entropic properties
In addition new algebraic vocabulary statistical approach novel aim Identify hidden variables data set using real world data rather artificial stimuli previously commonplace
Formulate prior distributions hidden variables models observed variables form vertices Gibbs like graph
Study randomness variability graphs
Create basic classes stochastic models applied listing deformations patterns
Synthesize sample models analyze signals The Brown University Pattern Theory Group formed Ulf Grenander
Many mathematicians currently working group noteworthy among Fields Medalist David Mumford
Mumford regards Grenander guru Pattern Theory
Example Natural Language Grammar We begin example motivate algebraic definitions follow
If want represent language patterns immediate candidate primitives might words
However set phrases order immediately indicate inappropriateness words atoms
In searching primitives might try rules grammar
We represent grammars finite state automata context free grammars
Below sample finite state grammar automaton
The following phrases generated simple rules automaton programming code pattern theory boy owned small cottage went deep forest prince walked lake girl walked lake princess went lake pretty prince walked dark forestTo create sentences rewriting rules finite state automata act generators create sentences follows machine starts state goes state writes word
From state writes one words prince boy princess girl chosen random
The probability choosing given word given Markov chain corresponding automaton
Such simplistic automaton occasionally generates awkward sentences evil evil prince walked lake prince walked dark forest prince walked forest princess lived big small big cottage owned small big small house went forestFrom finite state diagram infer following generators shown right creates signal
A generator tuple current state next state word written probability written word multiple choices
That generator state transition arrow state diagram Markov chain
Imagine configuration generators strung together linearly output forms sentence generator bonds generators
Denote bonds b b b
Each numerical label corresponds automaton state letter b corresponds inbound outbound bonds
Then following bond table left equivalent automaton diagram
For sake simplicity half bond table shown table actually symmetric
As one tell example typical signals studied identifying primitives bond tables requires thought
The example highlights another important fact readily apparent signals problems configuration signal observed rather image sentence observed
Herein lies significant justification distinguishing observable non observable construct
Additionally provides algebraic structure associate hidden Markov models
In sensory examples vision example hidden configurations observed images much similar distinction may seem justified
Fortunately grammar example reminds us distinction
A sophisticated example found link grammar theory natural language
Algebraic foundations Motivated example following definitions A generator g G displaystyle g G drawn primitive Pattern Theory generates observed signal
Structurally value interfaces called bonds b B displaystyle b B connects g displaystyle g form signal generator
neighboring generators connected bond values
Similarity self maps S displaystyle S G G express invariances world looking rigid body transformations scaling
Bonds glue generators configuration c creates signal backdrop Σ global features described locally bond coupling table called ρ displaystyle rho
The boolean function ρ displaystyle rho principal component regularity tuple G S ρ Σ defined ρ c neighboring bonds b b c ρ b b
displaystyle rho c prod _ text neighboring bonds b b c rho b b
ρ displaystyle rho seems capture notion allowable generator neighbors
That Regularity law stimulus domain defining via bond table neighbors acceptable generator
It laws stimulus domain
Later relax regularity boolean function probability value would capture stimulus neighbors probable
Σ physical arrangement generators
In vision could dimensional lattice
In language linear arrangement
An image C mod R captures notion observed Configuration opposed one exists independently perceptual apparatus
Images configurations distinguished external bonds inheriting configuration composition similarities transformations
Formally images equivalence classes partitioned Identification Rule properties ext c ext c whenever c c sc sc whenever c c sigma c c sigma c c whenever c c c c regular
A configuration corresponding physical stimulus may many images corresponding many observer perception identification rule
A pattern repeatable components image defined S invariant subset image
Similarities reference transformations use define patterns e g
rigid body transformations
At first glance definition seems suited texture patterns minimal sub image repeated
If view image object dog repeated yet seem like seems familiar pattern
A deformation transformation original image accounts noise environment error perceptual apparatus
Grenander identifies types deformations noise blur multi scale superposition domain warping interruptions
Example Directed boundary This configuration generators generating image created primitives woven together bonding table perceived observer identification rule maps non generators single boundary element
Nine undepicted generators created rotating non generators degrees
Keeping feature directed boundaries mind generators cooked thought interpreted follows generator corresponds interior elements exterior rotations straight elements remainder turning elements
With Boolean regularity defined Product nbr bonds configurations even single generator violating bond table discarded consideration
Thus features purest form neighboring generators adhering bond table allowed
This stringent condition relaxed using probability measures instead Boolean bond tables
p c neighboring bonds b b c A b b displaystyle p c prod _ text neighboring bonds b b c A b b The new regularity longer dictates perfect directed boundary defines probability configuration terms Acceptor function A
Such configurations allowed impurities imperfections respect feature interest With benefit given generators complete bond tables difficult part pattern analysis done
In tackling new class signals features task devising generators bond table much difficult
Again grammars identifying generators bond tables require thought
Just subtle fact configuration signal observe
Rather observe image silhouette projections identification rule
Entropy Pattern Theory defines order terms feature interest given p c
Energy c log P c Statistics Grenander Pattern Theory treatment Bayesian inference seems skewed towards image reconstruction e g

Fuzzy logic form many valued logic truth values variables may real number inclusive
It employed handle concept partial truth truth value may range completely true completely false
By contrast Boolean logic truth values variables may integer values
The term fuzzy logic introduced proposal fuzzy set theory Lotfi Zadeh
Fuzzy logic however studied since infinite valued logic notably Łukasiewicz Tarski Fuzzy logic based observation people make decisions based imprecise non numerical information
Fuzzy models sets mathematical means representing vagueness imprecise information hence term fuzzy
These models capability recognising representing manipulating interpreting utilising data information vague lack certainty Fuzzy logic applied many fields control theory artificial intelligence
Overview Classical logic permits conclusions either true false
However also propositions variable answers one might find asking group people identify color
In instances truth appears result reasoning inexact partial knowledge sampled answers mapped spectrum Both degrees truth probabilities range hence may seem similar first fuzzy logic uses degrees truth mathematical model vagueness probability mathematical model ignorance
Applying truth values A basic application might characterize various sub ranges continuous variable
For instance temperature measurement anti lock brakes might several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed control brakes properly
Each function maps temperature value truth value range
These truth values used determine brakes controlled
Linguistic variables While variables mathematics usually take numerical values fuzzy logic applications non numeric values often used facilitate expression rules facts A linguistic variable age may accept values young antonym old
Because natural languages always contain enough value terms express fuzzy value scale common practice modify linguistic values adjectives adverbs
For example use hedges rather somewhat construct additional values rather old somewhat young
Fuzzification operations map mathematical input values fuzzy membership functions
And opposite de fuzzifying operations used map fuzzy output membership function crisp output value used decision control purposes
Process Fuzzify input values fuzzy membership functions
Execute applicable rules rulebase compute fuzzy output functions
De fuzzify fuzzy output functions get crisp output values
Fuzzification Fuzzification process assigning numerical input system fuzzy sets degree membership
This degree membership may anywhere within interval
If value belong given fuzzy set value completely belongs within fuzzy set
Any value represents degree uncertainty value belongs set
These fuzzy sets typically described words assigning system input fuzzy sets reason linguistically natural manner
For example image meanings expressions cold warm hot represented functions mapping temperature scale
A point scale three truth values one three functions
The vertical line image represents particular temperature three arrows truth values gauge
Since red arrow points zero temperature may interpreted hot e
temperature zero membership fuzzy set hot
The orange arrow pointing may describe slightly warm blue arrow pointing fairly cold
Therefore temperature membership fuzzy set warm membership fuzzy set cold
The degree membership assigned fuzzy set result fuzzification
Fuzzy sets often defined triangle trapezoid shaped curves value slope value increasing peak value equal length greater slope value decreasing
They also defined using sigmoid function
One common case standard logistic function defined S x e x displaystyle S x frac e x following symmetry property From follows Fuzzy logic operators Fuzzy logic works membership values way mimics Boolean logic
To end replacements basic operators AND OR NOT must available
There several ways
A common replacement called Zadeh operators For TRUE FALSE fuzzy expressions produce result Boolean expressions
There also operators linguistic nature called hedges applied
These generally adverbs somewhat modify meaning set using mathematical formula However arbitrary choice table always define fuzzy logic function
In paper criterion formulated recognize whether given choice table defines fuzzy logic function simple algorithm fuzzy logic function synthesis proposed based introduced concepts constituents minimum maximum
A fuzzy logic function represents disjunction constituents minimum constituent minimum conjunction variables current area greater equal function value area right function value inequality including function value
Another set AND OR operators based multiplication x displaystyle x comes IF THEN rules IF THEN rules map input computed truth values desired output truth values
Example Given certain temperature fuzzy variable hot certain truth value copied high variable
Should output variable occur several THEN parts values respective IF parts combined using OR operator
Defuzzification The goal get continuous variable fuzzy truth values This would easy output truth values exactly obtained fuzzification given number
Since however output truth values computed independently cases represent set numbers
One decide number matches best intention encoded truth value
For example several truth values fan_speed actual speed must found best fits computed truth values variables slow moderate There single algorithm purpose
A common algorithm For truth value cut membership function value Combine resulting curves using OR operator Find center weight area curve The x position center final output
Forming consensus inputs fuzzy rules Since fuzzy system output consensus inputs rules fuzzy logic systems well behaved input values available trustworthy
Weightings optionally added rule rulebase weightings used regulate degree rule affects output values
These rule weightings based upon priority reliability consistency rule
These rule weightings may static changed dynamically even based upon output rules
Early applications Many early successful applications fuzzy logic implemented Japan
The first notable application subway train Sendai fuzzy logic able improve economy comfort precision ride
It also used recognition hand written symbols Sony pocket computers flight aid helicopters controlling subway systems order improve driving comfort precision halting power economy improved fuel consumption automobiles single button control washing machines automatic motor control vacuum cleaners recognition surface condition degree soiling prediction systems early recognition earthquakes Institute Seismology Bureau Meteorology Japan
Current applications In medical decision making Fuzzy logic important concept comes medical decision making
Since medical healthcare data subjective fuzzy applications domain great potential benefit lot using fuzzy logic based approaches
One common application areas use fuzzy logic computer aided diagnosis CAD medicine
CAD computerized set inter related tools used aid physicians diagnostic decision making
For example physician finds lesion abnormal still early stage development may use CAD approach characterize lesion diagnose nature
Fuzzy logic highly appropriate describe key characteristics lesion
Fuzzy logic used many different aspects within CAD framework
Such aspects include medical image analysis biomedical signal analysis segmentation images signals feature extraction selection images signals described instance
The biggest question application area much useful information derived using fuzzy logic
A major challenge derive required fuzzy data
This even challenging one elicit data humans usually patients
As said The envelope achieved cannot achieved medical diagnosis ironically fuzzy one Seven Challenges
How elicit fuzzy data validate accuracy data still ongoing effort strongly related application fuzzy logic
The problem assessing quality fuzzy data difficult one
This fuzzy logic highly promising possibility within CAD application area still requires research achieve full potential
Although concepts using fuzzy logic CAD exciting still several challenges fuzzy approaches face within CAD framework
Logical analysis In mathematical logic several formal systems fuzzy logic family norm fuzzy logics
Propositional fuzzy logics The important propositional fuzzy logics Monoidal norm based propositional fuzzy logic MTL axiomatization logic conjunction defined left continuous norm implication defined residuum norm

This means formula evaluation

Decidability issues fuzzy logic The notions decidable subset recursively enumerable subset basic ones classical mathematics classical logic
Thus question suitable extension fuzzy set theory crucial one
A first proposal direction made E S
Santos notions fuzzy Turing machine Markov normal fuzzy algorithm fuzzy program see Santos
Successively L Biacino G Gerla argued proposed definitions rather questionable
For example one shows fuzzy Turing machines adequate fuzzy language theory since natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable cannot recognized fuzzy Turing Machine
Then proposed following definitions
Denote Ü set rational numbers
Then fuzzy subset S displaystyle rightarrow set S recursively enumerable recursive map h S N displaystyle rightarrow Ü exists every x S function h x n increasing respect n x lim h x n
We say decidable complement recursively enumerable
An extension theory general case L subsets possible see Gerla
The proposed definitions well related fuzzy logic
Indeed following theorem holds true provided deduction apparatus considered fuzzy logic satisfies obvious effectiveness property
Any axiomatizable fuzzy theory recursively enumerable
In particular fuzzy set logically true formulas recursively enumerable spite fact crisp set valid formulas recursively enumerable general
Moreover axiomatizable complete theory decidable
It open question give supports Church thesis fuzzy mathematics proposed notion recursive enumerability fuzzy subsets adequate one
In order solve extension notions fuzzy grammar fuzzy Turing machine necessary
Another open question start notion find extension Gödel theorems fuzzy logic
Fuzzy databases Once fuzzy relations defined possible develop fuzzy relational databases
The first fuzzy relational database FRDB appeared Maria Zemankova dissertation
Later models arose like Buckles Petry model Prade Testemale Model Umano Fukami model GEFRED model J M
Medina M A
Vila et al
Fuzzy querying languages defined SQLf P Bosc et al
FSQL J Galindo et al
These languages define structures order include fuzzy aspects SQL statements like fuzzy conditions fuzzy comparators fuzzy constants fuzzy constraints fuzzy thresholds linguistic labels etc
The knowledge graph Weaviate uses fuzzy logic index data based machine learning model called Contextionary
Comparison probability Fuzzy logic probability address different forms uncertainty
While fuzzy logic probability theory represent degrees certain kinds subjective belief fuzzy set theory uses concept fuzzy set membership e much observation within vaguely defined set probability theory uses concept subjective probability e frequency occurrence likelihood event condition
The concept fuzzy sets developed mid twentieth century Berkeley response lacking probability theory jointly modelling uncertainty vagueness Bart Kosko claims Fuzziness vs Probability probability theory subtheory fuzzy logic questions degrees belief mutually exclusive set membership probability theory represented certain cases non mutually exclusive graded membership fuzzy theory
In context also derives Bayes theorem concept fuzzy subsethood
Lotfi A Zadeh argues fuzzy logic different character probability replacement
He fuzzified probability fuzzy probability also generalized possibility theory More generally fuzzy logic one many different extensions classical logic intended deal issues uncertainty outside scope classical logic inapplicability probability theory many domains paradoxes Dempster Shafer theory
Relation ecorithms Computational theorist Leslie Valiant uses term ecorithms describe many less exact systems techniques like fuzzy logic less robust logic applied learning algorithms
Valiant essentially redefines machine learning evolutionary
In general use ecorithms algorithms learn complex environments hence eco generalize approximate simplify solution logic
Like fuzzy logic methods used overcome continuous variables systems complex completely enumerate understand discretely exactly
Ecorithms fuzzy logic also common property dealing possibilities probabilities although feedback feed forward basically stochastic weights feature dealing example dynamical systems

The Pommerman Challenge multi agent game test autonomous artificial intelligence systems
Game structure Two agent team compete x board
Each agent observe part board agents cannot communicate
The goal knock opponents
Agents place explosives destroy walls collect power ups appear walls avoiding death
Game objects move unpredictably moved agent
Play The game involves real time decision making
Agents must choose moves seconds
Algorithms The real time requirement limits use compute heavy techniques Monte Carlo tree search
The branching factor move large four agents act step choosing among six possibilities
The agents choose accounting explosions lifetimes steps
Explosions derail tree search techniques searchews less levels ignore explosions deeper searches consider many choices given branching factor A hybrid approach uses limited depth tree search followed exploring deterministic pessimistic scenario
Limiting depth keeps search tree small
The deterministic approach predict far future omitting branching
Good actions often perform well pessimistic scenarios particularly safety important
Identifying worst sequence positions object suggest move
After generating pessimistic scenarios agent quantifies survivability move notionally number positions agent remain safely without encountering agents

Problem solving consists using generic ad hoc methods orderly manner find solutions problems
Some problem solving techniques developed used philosophy artificial intelligence computer science engineering mathematics medicine related mental problem solving techniques studied psychology
Definition The term problem solving slightly different meaning depending discipline
For instance mental process psychology computerized process computer science
There two different types problems ill defined well defined different approaches used
Well defined problems specific end goals clear expected solutions ill defined problems
Well defined problems allow initial planning ill defined problems
Solving problems sometimes involves dealing pragmatics way context contributes meaning semantics interpretation problem
The ability understand end goal problem rules could applied represents key solving problem
Sometimes problem requires abstract thinking coming creative solution
Psychology Problem solving psychology refers process finding solutions problems encountered life
Solutions problems usually situation context specific
The process starts problem finding problem shaping problem discovered simplified
The next step generate possible solutions evaluate
Finally solution selected implemented verified
Problems end goal reached get depends upon problem orientation problem solving coping style skills systematic analysis
Mental health professionals study human problem solving processes using methods introspection behaviorism simulation computer modeling experiment
Social psychologists look person environment relationship aspect problem independent interdependent problem solving methods
Problem solving defined higher order cognitive process intellectual function requires modulation control routine fundamental skills Problem solving two major domains mathematical problem solving personal problem solving
Both seen terms difficulty barrier encountered
Empirical research shows many different strategies factors influence everyday problem solving
Rehabilitation psychologists studying individuals frontal lobe injuries found deficits emotional control reasoning mediated effective rehabilitation could improve capacity injured persons resolve everyday problems
Interpersonal everyday problem solving dependent upon individual personal motivational contextual components
One component emotional valence real world problems either impede aid problem solving performance
Researchers focused role emotions problem solving demonstrating poor emotional control disrupt focus target task impede problem resolution likely lead negative outcomes fatigue depression inertia
In conceptualization human problem solving consists two related processes problem orientation motivational attitudinal affective approach problematic situations problem solving skills
Studies conclude people strategies cohere goals stem natural process comparing oneself others
Cognitive sciences The early experimental work Gestaltists Germany placed beginning problem solving study e g Karl Duncker book The psychology productive thinking
Later experimental work continued early research conducted relatively simple novel participants laboratory tasks problem solving
The use simple novel tasks due clearly defined optimal solutions short time solving made possible researchers trace participants steps problem solving process
Researchers underlying assumption simple tasks Tower Hanoi correspond main properties real world problems thus characteristic cognitive processes within participants attempts solve simple problems real world problems simple problems used reasons convenience expectation thought generalizations complex problems would become possible
Perhaps best known impressive example line research work Allen Newell Herbert A Simon
Other experts shown principle decomposition improves ability problem solver make good judgment
Computer science In computer science part artificial intelligence deals algorithms algorithmics problem solving includes techniques algorithms heuristics root cause analysis
In disciplines problem solving part larger process encompasses problem determination de duplication analysis diagnosis repair steps
Other problem solving tools linear nonlinear programming queuing systems simulation Much computer science involves designing completely automatic systems later solve specific problem systems accept input data reasonable amount time calculate correct response correct enough approximation
In addition people computer science spend surprisingly large amount human time finding fixing problems programs debugging
Logic Formal logic concerned issues validity truth inference argumentation proof
In problem solving context used formally represent problem theorem proved represent knowledge needed solve problem premises used proof problem solution
The use computers prove mathematical theorems using formal logic emerged field automated theorem proving
It included use heuristic methods designed simulate human problem solving Logic Theory Machine developed Allen Newell Herbert A Simon J C Shaw well algorithmic methods resolution principle developed John Alan Robinson
In addition use finding proofs mathematical theorems automated theorem proving also used program verification computer science
However already John McCarthy proposed advice taker represent information formal logic derive answers questions using automated theorem proving
An important step direction made Cordell Green using resolution theorem prover question answering applications artificial intelligence robot planning
The resolution theorem prover used Cordell Green bore little resemblance human problem solving methods
In response criticism approach emanating researchers MIT Robert Kowalski developed logic programming SLD resolution solves problems problem decomposition
He advocated logic computer human problem solving computational logic improve human thinking Engineering Problem solving used products processes fail corrective action taken prevent failures
It also applied product process prior actual failure event potential problem predicted analyzed mitigation applied problem never occurs
Techniques failure mode effects analysis used proactively reduce likelihood problems occurring
Forensic engineering important technique failure analysis involves tracing product defects flaws
Corrective action taken prevent failures
Reverse engineering attempts discover original problem solving logic used developing product taking apart
Military science In military science problem solving linked concept end states desired condition situation strategists wish generate
The ability solve problems important military rank highly critical command control level strictly correlated deep understanding qualitative quantitative scenarios
Effectiveness problem solving used measure result problem solving tied accomplishing goal
Planning problem solving process determining achieve goal Problem solving strategies Problem solving strategies steps one would use find problems way getting one goal
Some refer problem solving cycle
In cycle one recognize problem define problem develop strategy fix problem organize knowledge problem cycle figure resources user disposal monitor one progress evaluate solution accuracy
The reason called cycle one completed problem another usually pop
Insight sudden solution long vexing problem sudden recognition new idea sudden understanding complex situation Aha
moment
Solutions found insight often accurate found step step analysis
To solve problems faster rate insight necessary selecting productive moves different stages problem solving cycle
This problem solving strategy pertains specifically problems referred insight problem
Unlike Newell Simon formal definition move problems generally agreed upon definition insight problem Ash Jee Wiley Chronicle MacGregor Ormerod Chu MacGregor Blanchard Fields looks problem solving one two facets
The first looking problems one solution like mathematical problems fact based questions grounded psychometric intelligence
The socioemotional nature answers change constantly like favorite color get someone Christmas
The following techniques usually called problem solving strategies Abstraction solving problem model system applying real system Analogy using solution solves analogous problem Brainstorming especially among groups people suggesting large number solutions ideas combining developing optimum solution found Divide conquer breaking large complex problem smaller solvable problems Hypothesis testing assuming possible explanation problem trying prove contexts disprove assumption Lateral thinking approaching solutions indirectly creatively Means ends analysis choosing action step move closer goal Method focal objects synthesizing seemingly non matching characteristics different objects something new Morphological analysis assessing output interactions entire system Proof try prove problem cannot solved
The point proof fails starting point solving Reduction transforming problem another problem solutions exist Research employing existing ideas adapting existing solutions similar problems Root cause analysis identifying cause problem Trial error testing possible solutions right one found Problem solving methods Eight Disciplines Problem Solving GROW model How Solve It OODA loop observe orient decide act PDCA plan check act Root cause analysis RPR problem diagnosis rapid problem resolution TRIZ Russian Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach theory solving inventor problems A problem solving System dynamics Hive mind Common barriers Common barriers problem solving mental constructs impede ability correctly solve problems
These barriers prevent people solving problems efficient manner possible
Five common processes factors researchers identified barriers problem solving confirmation bias mental set functional fixedness unnecessary constraints irrelevant information
Confirmation bias Confirmation bias unintentional bias caused collection use data way favors preconceived notion
The beliefs affected confirmation bias need motivation desire defend find substantiation beliefs important person
Research found professionals within scientific fields study also experience confirmation bias
Andreas Hergovich Reinhard Schott Christoph Burger experiment conducted online instance suggested professionals within field psychological research likely view scientific studies agree preconceived notions favorably studies clash established beliefs
According Raymond Nickerson one see consequences confirmation bias real life situations range severity inefficient government policies genocide
Nickerson argued killed people accused witchcraft demonstrated confirmation bias motivation
Researcher Michael Allen found evidence confirmation bias motivation school children worked manipulate science experiments way would produce favorable results
However confirmation bias necessarily require motivation
In Peter Cathcart Wason conducted experiment participants first viewed three numbers created hypothesis proposed rule could used create triplet numbers
When testing hypotheses participants tended create additional triplets numbers would confirm hypotheses tended create triplets would negate disprove hypotheses
Thus research also shows people work confirm theories ideas support engage personally significant beliefs
Mental set Mental set first articulated Abraham Luchins demonstrated well known water jug experiments
In experiments participants asked fill one jug specific amount water using jugs typically three different maximum capacities tools
After Luchins gave participants set water jug problems could solved employing single technique would give problem could either solved using technique novel simpler method
Luchins discovered participants tended use technique become accustomed despite possibility using simpler alternative
Thus mental set describes one inclination attempt solve problems way proved successful previous experiences
However Luchins work revealed methods finding solution worked past may adequate optimal certain new similar problems
Therefore often necessary people move beyond mental sets order find solutions
This demonstrated Norman Maier experiment challenged participants solve problem using household object pliers unconventional manner
Maier observed participants often unable view object way strayed typical use phenomenon regarded particular form mental set specifically known functional fixedness topic following section
When people cling rigidly mental sets said experiencing fixation seeming obsession preoccupation attempted strategies repeatedly unsuccessful
In late researcher Jennifer Wiley worked reveal expertise work create mental set people considered experts fields gained evidence mental set created expertise could lead development fixation
Functional fixedness Functional fixedness specific form mental set fixation alluded earlier Maier experiment furthermore another way cognitive bias seen throughout daily life
Tim German Clark Barrett describe barrier fixed design object hindering individual ability see serving functions
In technical terms researchers explained ubjects become fixed design function objects problem solving suffers relative control conditions object function demonstrated
Functional fixedness defined primary function object hinder ability serving another purpose original function
In research highlighted primary reasons young children immune functional fixedness stated functional fixedness subjects hindered reaching solution problem knowledge object conventional function
Furthermore important note functional fixedness easily expressed commonplace situations
For instance imagine following situation man sees bug floor wants kill thing hand moment air freshener
If man starts looking around something house kill bug instead realizing air freshener could fact used main function freshen air said experiencing functional fixedness
The man knowledge served purely air freshener hindered ability realize could used serve another purpose instance instrument kill bug
Functional fixedness happen multiple occasions cause us certain cognitive biases
If people see object serving one primary focus fail realize object used various ways intended purpose
This turn cause many issues regards problem solving
Common sense seems plausible answer functional fixedness
One could make argument seems rather simple consider possible alternative uses object
Perhaps using common sense solve issue could accurate answer within context
With previous stated example seems would make perfect sense use air freshener kill bug rather search something else serve function research shows often case
Functional fixedness limits ability people solve problems accurately causing one narrow way thinking
Functional fixedness seen types learning behaviors well
For instance research discovered presence functional fixedness many educational instances
Researchers Furio Calatayud Baracenas Padilla stated functional fixedness may found learning concepts well solving chemistry problems
There emphasis function seen type subject others
There several hypotheses regards functional fixedness relates problem solving
There also many ways person run problems thinking particular object function
If one way person usually thinks something rather multiple ways lead constraint person thinks particular object
This seen narrow minded thinking defined way one able see accept certain ideas particular context
Functional fixedness closely related previously mentioned
This done intentionally unintentionally part seems process problem solving done unintentional way
Functional fixedness affect problem solvers least two particular ways
The first regards time functional fixedness causes people use time necessary solve given problem
Secondly functional fixedness often causes solvers make attempts solve problem would made experiencing cognitive barrier
In worst case functional fixedness completely prevent person realizing solution problem
Functional fixedness commonplace occurrence affects lives many people
Unnecessary constraints Unnecessary constraints another common barrier people face attempting problem solve
This particular phenomenon occurs subject trying solve problem subconsciously places boundaries task hand turn forces strain innovative thinking
The solver hits barrier become fixated one way solve problem becomes increasingly difficult see anything method chosen
Typically solver experiences attempting use method already experienced success help try make work present circumstances well even see counterproductive Groupthink taking mindset rest group members also act unnecessary constraint trying solve problems
This due fact everybody thinking thing stopping conclusions inhibiting think beyond
This common well known example barrier making present famous example dot problem
In example nine dots lying grid three dots across three dots running
The solver asked draw four lines without lifting pen pencil paper
This series lines connect dots paper
Then typically happens subject creates assumption mind must connect dots without letting pen pencil go outside square dots
Standardized procedures like often bring mentally invented constraints kind researchers found correct solution rate time allotted task completed
The imposed constraint inhibits solver think beyond bounds dots
It phenomenon expression think outside box derived This problem quickly solved dawning realization insight
A minutes struggling problem bring sudden insights solver quickly sees solution clearly
Problems typically solved via insight difficult subject depending either structured problem minds draw past experiences much juggle information working memories In case nine dot example solver already structured incorrectly minds constraint placed upon solution
In addition people experience struggles try compare problem prior knowledge think must keep lines within dots go beyond
They trying envision dots connected outside basic square puts strain working memory Luckily solution problem becomes obvious insight occurs following incremental movements made toward solution
These tiny movements happen without solver knowing
Then insight realized fully aha moment happens subject
These moments insight take long manifest long times way solution arrived toiling barriers stays
Irrelevant information Irrelevant information information presented within problem unrelated unimportant specific problem
Within specific context problem irrelevant information would serve purpose helping solve particular problem
Often irrelevant information detrimental problem solving process
It common barrier many people trouble getting especially aware
Irrelevant information makes solving otherwise relatively simple problems much harder For example Fifteen percent people Topeka unlisted telephone numbers
You select names random Topeka phone book
How many people unlisted phone numbers
The people listed phone book would among names selected
The individuals looking task would naturally wanted use given problem
They see information present immediately think needs used
This course true
These kinds questions often used test students taking aptitude tests cognitive evaluations
They meant difficult meant require thinking necessarily common
Irrelevant Information commonly represented math problems word problems specifically numerical information put purpose challenging individual
One reason irrelevant information effective keeping person topic away relevant information represented
The way information represented make vast difference difficult problem overcome
Whether problem represented visually verbally spatially mathematically irrelevant information profound effect long problem takes solved even possible
The Buddhist monk problem classic example irrelevant information represented different ways A Buddhist monk begins dawn one day walking mountain reaches top sunset meditates top several days one dawn begins walk back foot mountain reaches sunset
Making assumptions starting stopping pace trips prove place path occupies hour day two separate journeys This problem near impossible solve information represented
Because written way represents information verbally causes us try create mental image paragraph
This often difficult especially irrelevant information involved question
This example made much easier understand paragraph represented visually
Now problem asked also accompanied corresponding graph would far easier answer question irrelevant information longer serves road block
By representing problem visually difficult words understand scenarios imagine
The visual representation problem removed difficulty solving
These types representations often used make difficult problems easier
They used tests strategy remove Irrelevant Information one common forms barriers discussing issues problem solving
Identifying crucial information presented problem able correctly identify usefulness essential
Being aware irrelevant information first step overcoming common barrier
Dreaming problem solving without waking consciousness Problem solving also occur without waking consciousness
There many reports scientists engineers solved problems dreams
Elias Howe inventor sewing machine figured structure bobbin dream The chemist August Kekulé considering benzene arranged six carbon hydrogen atoms
Thinking problem dozed dreamt dancing atoms fell snakelike pattern led discover benzene ring
As Kekulé wrote diary One snakes seized hold tail form whirled mockingly eyes
As flash lightning I awoke time also I spent rest night working consequences hypothesis
There also empirical studies people think consciously problem going sleep solve problem dream image
Dream researcher William C Dement told undergraduate class students wanted think infinite series whose first elements OTTFF see could deduce principle behind say next elements series would
He asked think problem every night minutes going sleep write dreams
They instructed think problem minutes awakened morning
The sequence OTTFF first letters numbers one two three four five
The next five elements series SSENT six seven eight nine ten
Some students solved puzzle reflecting dreams
One example student reported following dream I standing art gallery looking paintings wall
As I walked hall I began count paintings one two three four five
As I came sixth seventh paintings ripped frames
I stared empty frames peculiar feeling mystery solved
Suddenly I realized sixth seventh spaces solution problem
With undergraduate students dreams judged related problems students assigned directly related indirectly related
Yet people dreams apparently solved problem seven actually able consciously know solution
The rest thought know solution
Mark Blechner conducted experiment obtained results similar Dement
He found trying solve problem people dreams solution appeared obvious dream rare dreamers realize dreams solved puzzle
Coaxing hints get realize although heard solution recognized dream solved
For example one person dreamed There big clock
You see movement
The big hand clock number six
You could see move number number six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
The dream focused small parts machinery
You could see gears inside
In dream person counted next elements series six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve yet realize solution problem
His sleeping mindbrain solved problem waking mindbrain aware
Albert Einstein believed much problem solving goes unconsciously person must figure formulate consciously mindbrain already solved
He believed process formulating theory relativity The creator problem possesses solution
Einstein said problem solving without words mostly images
The words language written spoken seem play role mechanism thought
The psychical entities seem serve elements thought certain signs less clear images voluntarily reproduced combined
Cognitive sciences two schools In cognitive sciences researchers realization problem solving processes differ across knowledge domains across levels expertise e g
Sternberg consequently findings obtained laboratory cannot necessarily generalize problem solving situations outside laboratory led emphasis real world problem solving since
This emphasis expressed quite differently North America Europe however
Whereas North American research typically concentrated studying problem solving separate natural knowledge domains much European research focused novel complex problems performed computerized scenarios see Funke overview
Europe In Europe two main approaches surfaced one initiated Donald Broadbent see Berry Broadbent United Kingdom one Dietrich Dörner see Dörner Wearing Germany
The two approaches share emphasis relatively complex semantically rich computerized laboratory tasks constructed resemble real life problems
The approaches differ somewhat theoretical goals methodology however
The tradition initiated Broadbent emphasizes distinction cognitive problem solving processes operate awareness versus outside awareness typically employs mathematically well defined computerized systems
The tradition initiated Dörner hand interest interplay cognitive motivational social components problem solving utilizes complex computerized scenarios contain highly interconnected variables e g Dörner Kreuzig Reither Stäudel LOHHAUSEN project Ringelband Misiak Kluwe
Buchner describes two traditions detail
North America In North America initiated work Herbert A Simon learning semantically rich domains researchers began investigate problem solving separately different natural knowledge domains physics writing chess playing thus relinquishing attempts extract global theory problem solving e g

Collective problem solving refers problem solving performed collectively
Social issues global issues typically solved collectively
It noted complexity contemporary problems exceeded cognitive capacity individual requires different complementary expertise collective problem solving ability Collective intelligence shared group intelligence emerges collaboration collective efforts competition many individuals
Collaborative problem solving people working together face face online workspaces focus solving real world problems
These groups made members share common concern similar passion commitment work
Members willing ask questions wonder try understand common issues
They share expertise experiences tools methods
These groups assigned instructors may student regulated based individual student needs
The groups group members may fluid based need may occur temporarily finish assigned task
They may also permanent nature depending needs learners
All members group must input decision making process role learning process
Group members responsible thinking teaching monitoring members group
Group work must coordinated among members member makes equal contribution whole work
Group members must identify build individual strengths everyone make significant contribution task
Collaborative groups require joint intellectual efforts members involve social interactions solve problems together
The knowledge shared interactions acquired communication negotiation production materials
Members actively seek information others asking questions
The capacity use questions acquire new information increases understanding ability solve problems
Collaborative group work ability promote critical thinking skills problem solving skills social skills self esteem
By using collaboration communication members often learn one another construct meaningful knowledge often leads better learning outcomes individual work In research report Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence organizational effectiveness predicted pro actively augmenting human intellect would yield multiplier effect group problem solving Three people working together augmented mode would seem three times effective solving complex problem one augmented person working alone Henry Jenkins key theorist new media media convergence draws theory collective intelligence attributed media convergence participatory culture
He criticizes contemporary education failing incorporate online trends collective problem solving classroom stating whereas collective intelligence community encourages ownership work group schools grade individuals
Jenkins argues interaction within knowledge community builds vital skills young people teamwork collective intelligence communities contributes development skills Collective impact commitment group actors different sectors common agenda solving specific social problem using structured form collaboration
After World War II UN Bretton Woods organization WTO created collective problem solving international level crystallized around three types organizations onward
As global institutions remain state like state centric called unsurprising continue state like state centric approaches collective problem solving rather alternative ones Crowdsourcing process accumulating ideas thoughts information many independent participants aim find best solution given challenge

In artificial intelligence frame problem describes issue using first order logic FOL express facts robot world
Representing state robot traditional FOL requires use many axioms simply imply things environment change arbitrarily
For example Hayes describes block world rules stacking blocks together
In FOL system additional axioms required make inferences environment example block cannot change position unless physically moved
The frame problem problem finding adequate collections axioms viable description robot environment John McCarthy Patrick J Hayes defined problem article Some Philosophical Problems Standpoint Artificial Intelligence
In paper many came formal mathematical problem starting point general discussions difficulty knowledge representation artificial intelligence
Issues provide rational default assumptions humans consider common sense virtual environment
Later term acquired broader meaning philosophy formulated problem limiting beliefs updated response actions
In logical context actions typically specified change implicit assumption everything else frame remains unchanged
Description The frame problem occurs even simple domains
A scenario door open closed light statically represented two propositions p e n displaystyle mathrm open n displaystyle mathrm
If conditions change better represented two predicates p e n displaystyle mathrm open n displaystyle mathrm depend time predicates called fluents
A domain door closed light time door opened time directly represented logic following formulae p e n displaystyle neg mathrm open n displaystyle neg mathrm p e n displaystyle mathrm open The first two formulae represent initial situation third formula represents effect executing action opening door time
If action preconditions door unlocked would represented l c k e p e n displaystyle neg mathrm locked implies mathrm open
In practice one would predicate e x e c u e p e n displaystyle mathrm executeopen specifying action executed rule
e x e c u e p e n p e n displaystyle forall mathrm executeopen implies mathrm open specifying effects actions
The article situation calculus gives details
While three formulae direct expression logic known suffice correctly draw consequences
While following conditions representing expected situation consistent three formulae ones
Indeed another set conditions consistent three formulae The frame problem specifying conditions changed actions entail conditions changed
This problem solved adding called frame axioms explicitly specify conditions affected actions changed executing action
For example since action executed time opening door frame axiom would state status light change time time n n displaystyle mathrm iff mathrm The frame problem one frame axiom necessary every pair action condition action affect condition
In words problem formalizing dynamical domain without explicitly specifying frame axioms
The solution proposed McCarthy solve problem involves assuming minimal amount condition changes occurred solution formalized using framework circumscription
The Yale shooting problem however shows solution always correct
Alternative solutions proposed involving predicate completion fluent occlusion successor state axioms etc
explained
By end frame problem defined McCarthy Hayes solved
Even however term frame problem still used part refer problem different settings e g concurrent actions part refer general problem representing reasoning dynamical domains
Solutions The following solutions depict frame problem solved various formalisms
The formalisms presented full presented simplified versions sufficient explain full solution
Fluent occlusion solution This solution proposed Erik Sandewall also defined formal language specification dynamical domains therefore domain first expressed language automatically translated logic
In article expression logic shown simplified language action names
The rationale solution represent value conditions time also whether affected last executed action
The latter represented another condition called occlusion
A condition said occluded given time point action executed makes condition true false effect
Occlusion viewed permission change condition occluded relieved obeying constraint inertia
In simplified example door light occlusion formalized two predicates c c l u e p e n displaystyle mathrm occludeopen c c l u e n displaystyle mathrm occludeon
The rationale condition change value corresponding occlusion predicate true next time point
In turn occlusion predicate true action affecting condition executed
p e n displaystyle neg mathrm open n displaystyle neg mathrm p e n c c l u e p e n displaystyle mathrm open wedge mathrm occludeopen
c c l u e p e n p e n p e n displaystyle forall neg mathrm occludeopen implies mathrm open iff mathrm open
c c l u e n n n displaystyle forall neg mathrm occludeon implies mathrm iff mathrm In general every action making condition true false also makes corresponding occlusion predicate true
In case c c l u e p e n displaystyle mathrm occludeopen true making antecedent fourth formula false displaystyle therefore constraint p e n p e n displaystyle mathrm open iff mathrm open hold displaystyle
Therefore p e n displaystyle mathrm open change value also enforced third formula
In order condition work occlusion predicates true made true effect action
This achieved either circumscription predicate completion
It worth noticing occlusion necessarily imply change example executing action opening door already open formalization makes predicate c c l u e p e n displaystyle mathrm occludeopen true makes p e n displaystyle mathrm open true however p e n displaystyle mathrm open changed value true already
Predicate completion solution This encoding similar fluent occlusion solution additional predicates denote change permission change
For example c h n g e p e n displaystyle mathrm changeopen represents fact predicate p e n displaystyle mathrm open change time displaystyle displaystyle
As result predicate changes corresponding change predicate true
An action results change makes true condition previously false vice versa
p e n displaystyle neg mathrm open n displaystyle neg mathrm p e n c h n g e p e n displaystyle neg mathrm open implies mathrm changeopen
c h n g e p e n p e n p e n displaystyle forall mathrm changeopen iff neg mathrm open iff mathrm open
c h n g e n n n displaystyle forall mathrm changeon iff neg mathrm iff mathrm The third formula different way saying opening door causes door opened
Precisely states opening door changes state door previously closed
The last two conditions state condition changes value time displaystyle corresponding change predicate true time displaystyle
To complete solution time points change predicates true possible done applying predicate completion rules specifying effects actions
Successor state axioms solution The value condition execution action determined fact condition true action makes condition true condition previously true action make false A successor state axiom formalization logic two facts
For example p e n r displaystyle mathrm opendoor c l e r displaystyle mathrm closedoor two conditions used denote action executed time displaystyle open close door respectively running example encoded follows
p e n displaystyle neg mathrm open n displaystyle neg mathrm p e n r displaystyle mathrm opendoor
p e n p e n r p e n c l e r displaystyle forall mathrm open iff mathrm opendoor vee mathrm open wedge neg mathrm closedoor This solution centered around value conditions rather effects actions
In words axiom every condition rather formula every action
Preconditions actions present example formalized formulae
The successor state axioms used variant situation calculus proposed Ray Reiter
Fluent calculus solution The fluent calculus variant situation calculus
It solves frame problem using first order logic terms rather predicates represent states
Converting predicates terms first order logic called reification fluent calculus seen logic predicates representing state conditions reified
The difference predicate term first order logic term representation object possibly complex object composed objects predicate represents condition true false evaluated given set terms
In fluent calculus possible state represented term obtained composition terms one representing conditions true state
For example state door open light represented term p e n n displaystyle mathrm open circ mathrm
It important notice term true false object condition
In words term p e n n displaystyle mathrm open circ mathrm represent possible state mean current state
A separate condition stated specify actually state given time e g e p e n n displaystyle mathrm state mathrm open circ mathrm means state time displaystyle
The solution frame problem given fluent calculus specify effects actions stating term representing state changes action executed
For example action opening door time represented formula e p e n e displaystyle mathrm state circ mathrm open iff mathrm state The action closing door makes condition false instead true represented slightly different way e e p e n displaystyle mathrm state iff mathrm state circ mathrm open This formula works provided suitable axioms given e displaystyle mathrm state displaystyle circ e g term containing condition twice valid state example e p e n p e n displaystyle mathrm state mathrm open circ circ mathrm open always false every displaystyle displaystyle
Event calculus solution The event calculus uses terms representing fluents like fluent calculus also axioms constraining value fluents like successor state axioms
In event calculus inertia enforced formulae stating fluent true true given previous time point action changing false performed meantime
Predicate completion still needed event calculus obtaining fluent made true action making true performed also obtaining action performed explicitly stated
Default logic solution The frame problem thought problem formalizing principle default everything presumed remain state Leibniz An Introduction Secret Encyclopædia c
This default sometimes called commonsense law inertia expressed Raymond Reiter default logic R x R x R x displaystyle frac R x R x mathrm R x mathrm R x displaystyle R x true situation displaystyle assumed R x displaystyle R x remains true executing action displaystyle conclude R x displaystyle R x remains true
Steve Hanks Drew McDermott argued basis Yale shooting example solution frame problem unsatisfactory
Hudson Turner showed however works correctly presence appropriate additional postulates
Answer set programming solution The counterpart default logic solution language answer set programming rule strong negation r X T r X T r X T displaystyle r X T leftarrow r X T hbox sim r X T r X displaystyle r X true time T displaystyle T assumed r X displaystyle r X remains true time T displaystyle T conclude r X displaystyle r X remains true
Action description languages Action description languages elude frame problem rather solving
An action description language formal language syntax specific describing situations actions
For example action p e n r displaystyle mathrm opendoor makes door open locked expressed p e n r displaystyle mathrm opendoor causes p e n displaystyle mathrm open l c k e displaystyle neg mathrm locked The semantics action description language depends language express concurrent actions delayed effects etc
usually based transition systems
Since domains expressed languages rather directly logic frame problem arises specification given action description logic translated logic
Typically however translation given languages answer set programming rather first order logic

Inductive functional programming uses functional programming languages Lisp Haskell especially inductive logic programming uses logic programming languages Prolog logical representations description logics prominent programming language paradigms also used constraint programming probabilistic programming
Definition Inductive programming incorporates approaches concerned learning programs algorithms incomplete formal specifications
Possible inputs IP system set training inputs corresponding outputs output evaluation function describing desired behavior intended program traces action sequences describe process calculating specific outputs constraints program induced concerning time efficiency complexity various kinds background knowledge standard data types predefined functions used program schemes templates describing data flow intended program heuristics guiding search solution biases
Output IP system program arbitrary programming language containing conditionals loop recursive control structures kind Turing complete representation language
In many applications output program must correct respect examples partial specification leads consideration inductive programming special area inside automatic programming program synthesis usually opposed deductive program synthesis specification usually complete
In cases inductive programming seen general area declarative programming representation language used may even degree error examples general machine learning specific area structure mining area symbolic artificial intelligence
A distinctive feature number examples partial specification needed
Typically inductive programming techniques learn examples
The diversity inductive programming usually comes applications languages used apart logic programming functional programming programming paradigms representation languages used suggested inductive programming functional logic programming constraint programming probabilistic programming abductive logic programming modal logic action languages agent languages many types imperative languages
History Research inductive synthesis recursive functional programs started early brought onto firm theoretical foundations seminal THESIS system Summers work Biermann
These approaches split two phases first input output examples transformed non recursive programs traces using small set basic operators second regularities traces searched used fold recursive program
The main results mid surveyed Smith
Due limited progress respect range programs could synthesized research activities decreased significantly next decade
The advent logic programming brought new elan also new direction early especially due MIS system Shapiro eventually spawning new field inductive logic programming ILP
The early works Plotkin relative least general generalization rlgg enormous impact inductive logic programming
Most ILP work addresses wider class problems focus recursive logic programs machine learning symbolic hypotheses logical representations
However encouraging results learning recursive Prolog programs quicksort examples together suitable background knowledge example GOLEM
But initial success community got disappointed limited progress induction recursive programs ILP less less focusing recursive programs leaning towards machine learning setting applications relational data mining knowledge discovery In parallel work ILP Koza proposed genetic programming early generate test based approach learning programs
The idea genetic programming developed inductive programming system ADATE systematic search based system MagicHaskeller
Here functional programs learned sets positive examples together output evaluation fitness function specifies desired input output behavior program learned
The early work grammar induction also known grammatical inference related inductive programming rewriting systems logic programs used represent production rules
In fact early works inductive inference considered grammar induction Lisp program inference basically problem
The results terms learnability related classical concepts identification limit introduced seminal work Gold
More recently language learning problem addressed inductive programming community In recent years classical approaches resumed advanced great success
Therefore synthesis problem reformulated background constructor based term rewriting systems taking account modern techniques functional programming well moderate use search based strategies usage background knowledge well automatic invention subprograms
Many new successful applications recently appeared beyond program synthesis especially area data manipulation programming example cognitive modelling see
Other ideas also explored common characteristic using declarative languages representation hypotheses
For instance use higher order features schemes structured distances advocated better handling recursive data types structures abstraction also explored powerful approach cumulative learning function invention One powerful paradigm recently used representation hypotheses inductive programming generally form generative models probabilistic programming related paradigms stochastic logic programs Bayesian logic programming

Typically DEL focuses situations involving multiple agents studies knowledge changes events occur
These events change factual properties actual world called ontic events example red card painted blue
They also bring changes knowledge without changing factual properties world called epistemic events example card revealed publicly privately red
Originally DEL focused epistemic events
We present entry basic ideas original DEL framework details DEL general found references
Due nature object study abstract approach DEL related applications numerous research areas computer science artificial intelligence philosophy formal epistemology economics game theory cognitive science
In computer science DEL example much related multi agent systems systems multiple intelligent agents interact exchange information
As combination dynamic logic epistemic logic dynamic epistemic logic young field research
It really started Plaza logic public announcement
Independently Gerbrandy Groeneveld proposed system dealing moreover private announcement inspired work Veltman
Another system proposed van Ditmarsch whose main inspiration Cluedo game
But influential original system system proposed Baltag Moss Solecki
This system deal types situations studied works underlying methodology conceptually grounded
We present entry basic ideas
Formally DEL extends ordinary epistemic logic inclusion event models describe actions product update operator defines epistemic models updated consequence executing actions described event models
Epistemic logic first recalled
Then actions events enter picture introduce DEL framework
Epistemic Logic Epistemic logic modal logic dealing notions knowledge belief
As logic concerned understanding process reasoning knowledge belief principles relating notions knowledge belief intuitively plausible
Like epistemology stems Greek word ϵ π ι σ τ η μ η displaystyle epsilon pi iota sigma tau eta mu eta episteme meaning knowledge
Epistemology nevertheless concerned analyzing nature scope knowledge addressing questions What definition knowledge How knowledge acquired
In fact epistemic logic grew epistemology Middle Ages thanks efforts Burley Ockham
The formal work based modal logic inaugurated contemporary research epistemic logic dates back due Hintikka
It sparked discussions principles knowledge belief many axioms notions proposed discussed
For example interaction axioms K p B p displaystyle Kp rightarrow Bp B p K B p displaystyle Bp rightarrow KBp often considered intuitive principles agent Knows p displaystyle p also Believes p displaystyle p agent Believes p displaystyle p Knows Believes p displaystyle p
More recently kinds philosophical theories taken researchers economics artificial intelligence theoretical computer science reasoning knowledge central topic

Group notions general common distributed knowledge
In multi agent setting three important epistemic concepts general knowledge distributed knowledge common knowledge
The notion common knowledge first studied Lewis context conventions
It applied distributed systems game theory allows express rationality players rules game set players commonly known
General knowledge
General knowledge ϕ displaystyle phi means everybody group agents A G T S displaystyle AGTS knows ϕ displaystyle phi
Formally corresponds following formula E ϕ j A G T S K j ϕ
displaystyle E phi underset j AGTS bigwedge K_ j phi
Common knowledge
Common knowledge ϕ displaystyle phi means everybody knows ϕ displaystyle phi also everybody knows everybody knows ϕ displaystyle phi everybody knows everybody knows everybody knows ϕ displaystyle phi ad infinitum
Formally corresponds following formula C ϕ E ϕ E E ϕ E E E ϕ displaystyle C phi E phi land EE phi land EEE phi land ldots As allow infinite conjunction notion common knowledge introduced primitive language
Before defining language new operator going give example introduced Lewis illustrates difference notions general knowledge common knowledge
Lewis wanted know kind knowledge needed statement p displaystyle p every driver must drive right convention among group agents
In words wanted know kind knowledge needed everybody feels safe drive right
Suppose two agents displaystyle j displaystyle j
Then everybody knowing p displaystyle p formally E p displaystyle Ep enough
Indeed might still possible agent displaystyle considers possible agent j displaystyle j know p displaystyle p formally K K j p displaystyle neg K_ K_ j p
In case agent displaystyle feel safe drive right might consider agent j displaystyle j knowing p displaystyle p could drive left
To avoid problem could assume everybody knows everybody knows p displaystyle p formally E E p displaystyle EEp
This enough ensure everybody feels safe drive right
Indeed might still possible agent displaystyle considers possible agent j displaystyle j considers possible agent displaystyle know p displaystyle p formally K K j K p displaystyle neg K_ K_ j K_ p
In case displaystyle point view j displaystyle j considers possible displaystyle knowing p displaystyle p drive left
So displaystyle point view j displaystyle j might drive left well argument
So displaystyle feel safe drive right
Reasoning induction Lewis showed k N displaystyle k mathbb N E p E p E k p displaystyle Ep land E p land ldots land E k p enough drivers feel safe drive right
In fact need infinite conjunction
In words need common knowledge p displaystyle p C p displaystyle Cp
Distributed knowledge

This example depicted pointed epistemic model M w displaystyle mathcal M w represented
In example A G T S A B C displaystyle AGTS A B C P R O P A B C B C A C A B displaystyle PROP color red A color green B color blue C color red B color green C color blue A color red C color green A color blue B
Each world labelled propositional letters true world w displaystyle w corresponds actual world
There arrow indexed agent j A B C displaystyle j A B C possible world u displaystyle u possible world v displaystyle v u v R j displaystyle u v R_ j

A displaystyle color red A stands A displaystyle A red card C displaystyle color blue C stand C displaystyle C blue card B displaystyle color green B stands B displaystyle B green card
When accessibility relations equivalence relations like example w v R j displaystyle w v R_ j say agent j displaystyle j cannot distinguish world w displaystyle w world v displaystyle v world w displaystyle w indistinguishable world v displaystyle v agent j displaystyle j
So example A textstyle A cannot distinguish actual world w displaystyle w possible world B displaystyle B blue card B displaystyle color blue B C displaystyle C green card C displaystyle color green C A displaystyle A still red card A displaystyle color red A
In particular following statements hold M w A K A A C K C C B K B B displaystyle mathcal M w models color red A land K_ A color red A land color blue C land K_ C color blue C land color green B land K_ B color green B All agents know color card

Knowledge versus Belief We use notation K j displaystyle K_ j knowledge belief
Hence depending context K j ϕ displaystyle K_ j phi either read agent j displaystyle j Knows ϕ displaystyle phi holds agent j displaystyle j Believes ϕ displaystyle phi holds
A crucial difference unlike knowledge beliefs wrong axiom K j ϕ ϕ displaystyle K_ j phi rightarrow phi holds knowledge necessarily belief
This axiom called axiom T Truth states agent knows proposition proposition true
It often considered hallmark knowledge subjected serious attack ever since introduction Theaetetus Plato
The notion knowledge might comply constraints axioms K j ϕ K j K j ϕ displaystyle K_ j phi rightarrow K_ j K_ j phi agent j displaystyle j knows something knows knows
These constraints might affect nature accessibility relations R j displaystyle R_ j may comply extra properties
So going define particular classes epistemic models add extra constraints accessibility relations R j displaystyle R_ j
These constraints matched particular axioms knowledge operator K j displaystyle K_ j
Below property give axiom defines class epistemic frames fulfill property
K ϕ displaystyle K phi stands K j ϕ displaystyle K_ j phi j A G T S displaystyle j AGTS
We discuss axioms
Axiom states agent knows proposition knows knows axiom also known KK principle KK thesis
In epistemology axiom tends accepted internalists externalists
Axiom nevertheless widely accepted computer scientists also many philosophers including Plato Aristotle Saint Augustine Spinoza Schopenhauer Hintikka recalls
A controversial axiom logic knowledge axiom Euclidicity axiom states agent know proposition knows know
Most philosophers including Hintikka attacked axiom since numerous examples everyday life seem invalidate
In general axiom invalidated agent mistaken beliefs due example misperceptions lies forms deception
Axiom B states cannot case agent considers possible knows false proposition ϕ K K ϕ displaystyle neg neg phi land neg K neg K phi
If assume axioms T valid axiom B falls prey attack one axiom since axiom derivable
Axiom D states agent beliefs consistent
In combination axiom K knowledge operator replaced belief operator axiom D fact equivalent simpler axiom D conveys maybe explicitly fact agent beliefs cannot inconsistent B displaystyle neg B bot
The intricate axioms introduced epistemic logicians Lenzen Kutchera presented key axioms epistemic logic
They characterized terms intuitive interaction axioms relating knowledge beliefs
Axiomatization The Hilbert proof system K basic modal logic defined following axioms inference rules j A G T S displaystyle j AGTS The axioms epistemic logic obviously display way agents reason

Decidability Complexity The satisfiability problem logics introduced decidable

Adding Dynamics Dynamic Epistemic Logic DEL logical framework modeling epistemic situations involving several agents changes occur situations result incoming information generally incoming action
The methodology DEL splits task representing agents beliefs knowledge three parts One represents beliefs initial situation thanks epistemic model One represents beliefs event taking place situation thanks event model One represents way agents update beliefs situation occurrence event thanks product update Typically informative event public announcement agents formula ψ displaystyle psi public announcement correlative update constitute dynamic part
However epistemic events much complex simple public announcement including hiding information agents cheating lying bluffing etc
This complexity dealt introduce notion event model
We first focus public announcements get intuition main underlying ideas DEL
Public Events In section assume events public
We start giving concrete example DEL used better understand going
This example called muddy children puzzle
Then present formalization puzzle logic called Public Announcement Logic PAL
The muddy children puzzle one well known puzzles played role development DEL
Other significant puzzles include sum product puzzle Monty Hall dilemma Russian cards problem two envelopes problem Moore paradox hangman paradox etc Muddy Children Example We two children A B dirty
A see B B see A
Let p displaystyle p proposition stating A dirty q displaystyle q proposition stating B dirty
We represent initial situation pointed epistemic model N displaystyle mathcal N represented relations worlds equivalence relations
States u v displaystyle u v intuitively represent possible worlds proposition example p displaystyle p satisfiable one worlds intuitively means corresponding possible world intuitive interpretation p displaystyle p A dirty true
The links worlds labelled agents A B intuitively express notion indistinguishability agent stake two possible worlds
For example link displaystyle displaystyle labelled A intuitively means A distinguish possible world displaystyle displaystyle vice versa
Indeed A cannot see cannot distinguish world dirty one dirty
However distinguish worlds B dirty see B
With intuitive interpretation brought assume relations worlds equivalence relations
Now suppose father comes announces least one dirty formally p q displaystyle p vee q
Then update model yields pointed epistemic model represented
What actually suppressing worlds content announcement fulfilled
In case world p displaystyle neg p q displaystyle neg q true
This suppression call update
We get model depicted
As result announcement A B know least one dirty
We read epistemic model
Now suppose second final announcement says neither knows dirty announcement express facts situation well epistemic facts knowledge held agents
We update similarly model suppressing worlds satisfy content announcement equivalently keeping worlds satisfy announcement
This update process thus yields pointed epistemic model represented
By interpreting model get A B know dirty seems contradict content announcement
However assume A B perfect reasoners common knowledge among inference makes perfect sense
Public announcement logic PAL We present syntax semantic Public Announcement Logic PAL combines features epistemic logic propositional dynamic logic We define language L P A L displaystyle mathcal L _ PAL inductively following grammar BNF L P A L ϕ p ϕ ϕ ϕ K j ϕ ϕ
ϕ displaystyle mathcal L _ PAL phi p mid neg phi mid phi land phi mid K_ j phi mid phi
phi j A G T S displaystyle j AGTS
The language L P A L displaystyle mathcal L _ PAL interpreted epistemic models
The truth conditions connectives epistemic language epistemic logic see
The truth condition new dynamic action modality ψ
ϕ displaystyle psi
phi defined follows M ψ W ψ R ψ R n ψ I ψ displaystyle mathcal M psi W psi R_ psi ldots R_ n psi I psi W ψ w W M w ψ displaystyle W psi w W mathcal M w models psi R j ψ R j W ψ W ψ displaystyle R_ j psi R_ j cap W psi times W psi j n displaystyle j ldots n I ψ w I w w W ψ displaystyle I psi w I w textrm w W psi
The formula ψ
ϕ displaystyle psi
phi intuitively means truthful announcement ψ displaystyle psi ϕ displaystyle phi holds
A public announcement proposition ψ displaystyle psi changes current epistemic model like figure
The proof system H P A L displaystyle mathcal H _ PAL defined sound strongly complete L P A L displaystyle mathcal L _ PAL w r
class pointed epistemic models
The axioms Red Red called reduction axioms allow reduce formula L P A L displaystyle mathcal L _ PAL provably equivalent formula L E L displaystyle mathcal L _ EL H P A L displaystyle mathcal H _ PAL
The formula q
K q displaystyle q
Kq theorem provable H P A L displaystyle mathcal H _ PAL
It states public announcement q displaystyle q agent knows q displaystyle q holds
PAL decidable model checking problem solvable polynomial time satisfiability problem PSPACE complete Muddy children puzzle formalized PAL Here statements hold muddy children puzzle formalized PAL
N p q displaystyle mathcal N models p land q In initial situation A dirty B dirty
N K A p K A p K B q K B q displaystyle mathcal N models neg K_ A p land neg K_ A neg p land neg K_ B q land neg K_ B neg q In initial situation A know whether dirty B neither
N p q
K A p q K B p q displaystyle mathcal N models p vee q
K_ A p vee q land K_ B p vee q After public announcement least one children A B dirty know least one dirty
However N p q
K A p K A p K B q K B q displaystyle mathcal N models p vee q
neg K_ A p land neg K_ A neg p land neg K_ B q land neg K_ B neg q After public announcement least one children A B dirty still know dirty
Moreover N p q
K A p K A p K B q K B q
K A p K B q displaystyle mathcal N models p vee q
neg K_ A p land neg K_ A neg p land neg K_ B q land neg K_ B neg q
K_ A p land K_ B q After successive public announcements least one children A B dirty still know whether dirty A B know dirty
In last statement see work interesting feature update process formula necessarily true announced
That technically call self persistence problem arises epistemic formulas unlike propositional formulas
One must confuse announcement update induced announcement might cancel information encoded announcement
Arbitrary Events In section assume events necessarily public focus items namely represent events update epistemic model representation events means product update
Event Model Epistemic models used model agents perceive actual world
Their perception also described terms knowledge beliefs world agents beliefs
The insight DEL approach one describe event perceived agents similar way
Indeed agents perception event also described terms knowledge beliefs
For example private announcement A displaystyle A B displaystyle B card red also described terms knowledge beliefs A displaystyle A tells B displaystyle B card red event e displaystyle e C displaystyle C believes nothing happens event f displaystyle f
This leads define notion event model whose definition similar epistemic model
A pointed event model E e displaystyle mathcal E e represents actual event represented e displaystyle e perceived agents
Intuitively f R j e displaystyle f R_ j e means possible event represented e displaystyle e occurring agent j displaystyle j considers possible possible event represented f displaystyle f actually occurring
An event model tuple E W α R α R α I α displaystyle mathcal E W alpha R_ alpha ldots R_ alpha I alpha W α displaystyle W alpha non empty set possible events R j α W α W α displaystyle R_ j alpha subseteq W alpha times W alpha binary relation called accessibility relation W α displaystyle W alpha j A G T S displaystyle j AGTS I α W α L EL displaystyle I alpha W alpha rightarrow mathcal L _ textsf EL function called precondition function assigning possible event formula L EL displaystyle mathcal L _ textsf EL
R j α e displaystyle R_ j alpha e denotes set f W α e f R j α displaystyle f W alpha e f R_ j alpha We write e E displaystyle e mathcal E e W α displaystyle e W alpha E e displaystyle mathcal E e called pointed event model e displaystyle e often represents actual event
Card Example Let us resume card example assume players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B show card
As turns C displaystyle C noticed A displaystyle A showed card B displaystyle B notice B displaystyle B A displaystyle A
Players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B know
This event represented event model E e displaystyle mathcal E e
The possible event e displaystyle e corresponds actual event players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B show cards respectively precondition A B displaystyle color red A land color green B f displaystyle f stands event player A displaystyle A shows green card precondition A displaystyle color green A g displaystyle g stands atomic event player A displaystyle A shows red card precondition A displaystyle color red A
Players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B show cards players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B know consider possible player C displaystyle C considers possible player A displaystyle A shows red card also considers possible player A displaystyle A shows green card since know card
In fact player C displaystyle C considers possible notice B displaystyle B showed card
Another example event model given
This second example corresponds event whereby Player A displaystyle A shows red card publicly everybody
Player A displaystyle A shows red card players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B C displaystyle C know players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B C displaystyle C know knows etc
In words common knowledge among players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B C displaystyle C player A displaystyle A shows red card
Product Update The DEL product update defined
This update yields new pointed epistemic model M w E e displaystyle mathcal M w otimes mathcal E e representing new situation previously represented M w displaystyle mathcal M w perceived agents occurrence event represented E e displaystyle mathcal E e
Let M W R R n I displaystyle mathcal M W R_ ldots R_ n I epistemic model let E W α R α R n α I α displaystyle mathcal E W alpha R_ alpha ldots R_ n alpha I alpha event model
The product update M displaystyle mathcal M E displaystyle mathcal E epistemic model M E W R R n I displaystyle mathcal M otimes mathcal mathcal E W otimes R_ otimes ldots R_ n otimes I otimes defined follows v W displaystyle v W f W α displaystyle f W alpha If w W displaystyle w W e W α displaystyle e W alpha M w I α e displaystyle mathcal M w models I alpha e M w E e displaystyle mathcal M w otimes mathcal E e denotes pointed epistemic model M E w e displaystyle mathcal M otimes mathcal E w e
This definition product update conceptually grounded Card Example As result first event described Players A displaystyle A B displaystyle B show cards front player C displaystyle C agents update beliefs
We get situation represented pointed epistemic model M w E e displaystyle mathcal M w otimes mathcal E e
In pointed epistemic model following statement holds M w E e B K A B K C K A B
displaystyle mathcal M w otimes mathcal E e models color green B land K_ A color green B land K_ C neg K_ A color green B
It states player A displaystyle A knows player B displaystyle B card player C displaystyle C believes case
The result second event represented
In pointed epistemic model following statement holds M w F e C B C A B C K A B C displaystyle mathcal M w otimes mathcal F e models C_ B C color red A land color green B land color blue C land neg K_ A color green B land color blue C
It states common knowledge among B displaystyle B C displaystyle C know true state world namely A displaystyle A red card B displaystyle B green card C displaystyle C blue card A displaystyle A know
Based three components epistemic model event model product update Baltag Moss Solecki defined general logical language inspired logical language propositional dynamic logic reason information knowledge change

Perceptual computing application Zadeh theory computing words field assisting people make subjective judgments
Perceptual computer The perceptual computer Per C instantiation perceptual computing architecture depicted Fig

It consists three components encoder CWW engine decoder
Perceptions words activate Per C Per C output along data possible human interact Per C using vocabulary
A vocabulary application context dependent must large enough lets end user interact Per C user friendly manner
The encoder transforms words fuzzy sets FSs leads codebook words associated FS models
The outputs encoder activate Computing With Words CWW engine whose output one FSs mapped decoder recommendation subjective judgment supporting data
The recommendation may form word group similar words rank class
Although lots details needed order implement Per C three components encoder decoder CWW engine covered Per C applied specific applications focus methodology becomes clear
Stepping back details methodology perceptual computing Focus application A
Establish vocabulary vocabularies A
Collect interval end point data group subjects representative subjects use Per C words vocabulary
Map collected word data word FOUs using Interval Approach Ch

The result codebook codebooks A completes design encoder Per C
Choose appropriate CWW engine A
It map IT FSs one IT FSs
Examples CWW engines IF THEN rules Ch
Linguistic Weighted Averages Ch

If existing CWW engine available A use available mathematics compute output
Otherwise develop mathematics new kind CWW engine
The new CWW engine constrained output resemble FOUs codebook A Map IT FS outputs CWW engine recommendation output decoder
If recommendation word rank class use existing mathematics accomplish mapping Ch

Otherwise develop mathematics new kind decoder
Applications Per C To date Per C implemented following four applications investment decision making social judgment making distributed decision making hierarchical distributed decision making
A specific example fourth application called Journal Publication Judgment Advisor Ch
first time words used every level following hierarchical distributed decision making process n reviewers provide subjective recommendation journal article sent Associate Editor aggregate independent recommendations final recommendation sent Editor Chief journal
Because problematic ask reviewers provide numerical scores paper evaluation sub categories two major categories Technical Merit Presentation importance content depth style organization clarity references etc reviewer asked provide linguistic score categories
They asked overall recommendation paper past quite common reviewers provide numerical scores categories give different publishing recommendations
By leaving specific recommendation associate editor inconsistencies hope eliminated
How words aggregated reflect reviewer recommendation well expertise reviewer paper subject matter done using linguistic weighted average
Although journal publication judgment advisor uses reviewers associate editor word reviewer could replaced judge expert low level manager commander referee etc term associate editor could replaced control center command center higher level manager etc
So application potential wide applicability many applications
Recently new Per C based Failure mode effects analysis FMEA methodology developed application edible bird nest farming Borneo reported
In summary Per C whose development taken decade first complete implementation Zadeh CWW paradigm applied assisting people make subjective judgments

The aim theory artificial consciousness Define would synthesized consciousness found engineered artifact Aleksander
Neuroscience hypothesizes consciousness generated interoperation various parts brain called neural correlates consciousness NCC though challenges perspective
Proponents AC believe possible construct systems e g computer systems emulate NCC interoperation Artificial consciousness concepts also pondered philosophy artificial intelligence questions mind consciousness mental states
Philosophical views As many hypothesized types consciousness many potential implementations artificial consciousness
In philosophical literature perhaps common taxonomy consciousness access phenomenal variants
Access consciousness concerns aspects experience apprehended phenomenal consciousness concerns aspects experience seemingly cannot apprehended instead characterized qualitatively terms raw feels like qualia Block
Plausibility debate Type identity theorists skeptics hold view consciousness realized particular physical systems consciousness properties necessarily depend physical constitution Block Bickle In article Artificial Consciousness Utopia Real Possibility Giorgio Buttazzo says common objection artificial consciousness Working fully automated mode computers cannot exhibit creativity emotions free
A computer like washing machine slave operated components
For theorists e g functionalists define mental states terms causal roles system instantiate pattern causal roles regardless physical constitution instantiate mental states including consciousness Putnam
Computational Foundation argument One explicit arguments plausibility AC comes David Chalmers
His proposal found within article Chalmers roughly right kinds computations sufficient possession conscious mind
In outline defends claim thus Computers perform computations
Computations capture systems abstract causal organization
The controversial part Chalmers proposal mental properties organizationally invariant
Mental properties two kinds psychological phenomenological
Psychological properties belief perception characterized causal role
He adverts work Armstrong Lewis claiming ystems causal topology share psychological properties
Phenomenological properties prima facie definable terms causal roles
Establishing phenomenological properties amenable individuation causal role therefore requires argument
Chalmers provides Dancing Qualia Argument purpose Chalmers begins assuming agents identical causal organizations could different experiences
He asks us conceive changing one agent replacement parts neural parts replaced silicon say preserving causal organization
Ex hypothesi experience agent transformation would change parts replaced would change causal topology therefore means whereby agent could notice shift experience
Critics AC object Chalmers begs question assuming mental properties external connections sufficiently captured abstract causal organization
Ethics If suspected particular machine conscious rights would ethical issue would need assessed e g
rights would law
For example conscious computer owned used tool central computer building larger machine particular ambiguity
Should laws made case
Consciousness would also require legal definition particular case

Awareness Awareness could one required aspect many problems exact definition awareness
The results experiments neuroscanning monkeys suggest process state object activates neurons
Awareness includes creating testing alternative models process based information received senses imagined also useful making predictions
Such modeling needs lot flexibility
Creating model includes modeling physical world modeling one internal states processes modeling conscious entities
There least three types awareness agency awareness goal awareness sensorimotor awareness may also conscious
For example agency awareness may aware performed certain action yesterday conscious
In goal awareness may aware must search lost object conscious
In sensorimotor awareness may aware hand resting object conscious
Because objects awareness often conscious distinction awareness consciousness frequently blurred used synonyms
Memory Conscious events interact memory systems learning rehearsal retrieval

Graziano went publish expanded discussion theory book Consciousness Social Brain
This Attention Schema Theory Consciousness named proposes brain tracks attention various sensory inputs way attention schema analogous well study body schema tracks spatial place person body
This relates artificial consciousness proposing specific mechanism information handling produces allegedly experience describe consciousness able duplicated machine using current technology
When brain finds person X aware thing Y effect modeling state person X applying attentional enhancement Y

Graziano proposes specific locations brain process suggests awareness computed feature constructed expert system brain
Self modeling In order self aware robots may use internal models simulate actions
Testing The well known method testing machine intelligence Turing test
But interpreted observational test contradicts philosophy science principles theory dependence observations
It also suggested Alan Turing recommendation imitating human adult consciousness human child consciousness taken seriously Other tests ConsScale test presence features inspired biological systems measure cognitive development artificial systems
Qualia phenomenological consciousness inherently first person phenomenon
Although various systems may display various signs behavior correlated functional consciousness conceivable way third person tests access first person phenomenological features
Because empirical definition consciousness test presence consciousness AC may impossible
In Victor Argonov suggested non Turing test machine consciousness based machine ability produce philosophical judgments
He argues deterministic machine must regarded conscious able produce judgments problematic properties consciousness qualia binding innate preloaded philosophical knowledge issues philosophical discussions learning informational models creatures memory models may implicitly explicitly contain knowledge creatures consciousness
However test used detect refute existence consciousness
A positive result proves machine conscious negative result proves nothing
For example absence philosophical judgments may caused lack machine intellect absence consciousness

In natural language processing language identification language guessing problem determining natural language given content
Computational approaches problem view special case text categorization solved various statistical methods
Overview There several statistical approaches language identification using different techniques classify data
One technique compare compressibility text compressibility texts set known languages
This approach known mutual information based distance measure
The technique also used empirically construct family trees languages closely correspond trees constructed using historical methods
Mutual information based distance measure essentially equivalent conventional model based methods generally considered either novel better simpler techniques
Another technique described Cavnar Trenkle Dunning create language n gram model training text languages
These models based characters Cavnar Trenkle encoded bytes Dunning latter language identification character encoding detection integrated
Then piece text needing identified similar model made model compared stored language model
The likely language one model similar model text needing identified
This approach problematic input text language model
In case method may return another similar language result
Also problematic approach pieces input text composed several languages common Web
For recent method see Řehůřek Kolkus
This method detect multiple languages unstructured piece text works robustly short texts words something n gram approaches struggle
An older statistical method Grefenstette based prevalence certain function words e g English
Identifying similar languages One great bottlenecks language identification systems distinguish closely related languages
Similar languages like Serbian Croatian Indonesian Malay present significant lexical structural overlap making challenging systems discriminate
Recently DSL shared task organized providing dataset Tan et al containing different languages language varieties six language groups Group A Bosnian Croatian Serbian Group B Indonesian Malaysian Group C Czech Slovak Group D Brazilian Portuguese European Portuguese Group E Peninsular Spain Argentine Spanish Group F American English British English
The best system reached performance results Goutte et al

Spreading activation method searching associative networks biological artificial neural networks semantic networks
The search process initiated labeling set source nodes e g
concepts semantic network weights activation iteratively propagating spreading activation nodes linked source nodes
Most often weights real values decay activation propagates network
When weights discrete process often referred marker passing
Activation may originate alternate paths identified distinct markers terminate two alternate paths reach node
However brain studies show several different brain areas play important role semantic processing Spreading activation models used cognitive psychology model fan effect
Spreading activation also applied information retrieval means network nodes representing documents terms contained documents
Cognitive psychology As relates cognitive psychology spreading activation theory brain iterates network associated ideas retrieve specific information
The spreading activation theory presents array concepts within memory cognitive units consisting node associated elements characteristics connected together edges
A spreading activation network represented schematically sort web diagram shorter lines two nodes meaning ideas closely related typically associated quickly original concept
For memory psychology Spreading activation model means people organize knowledge world based personal experience saying personal experiences form network ideas person knowledge world When word target preceded associated word prime word recognition tasks participants seem perform better amount time takes respond
For instance subjects respond faster word doctor preceded nurse preceded unrelated word like carrot
This semantic priming effect words close meaning within cognitive network seen wide range tasks given experimenters ranging sentence verification lexical decision naming As another example original concept red concept vehicles primed much likely say fire engine instead something unrelated vehicles cherries
If instead fruits primed would likely name cherries continue
The activation pathways network everything closely linked two concepts meaning well subject primed
Algorithm A directed graph populated Nodes N associated activation value A real number range
A Link j connects source node target node j
Each edge associated weight W j usually real number range Parameters Firing threshold F real number range Decay factor D real number range Steps Initialize graph setting activation values A zero
Set one origin nodes initial activation value greater firing threshold F A typical initial value
For unfired node graph activation value A greater node firing threshold F For Link j connecting source node target node j adjust A j A j A W j D D decay factor
If target node receives adjustment activation value would exceed set new activation value
Likewise maintain lower bound target node activation value receive adjustment
Once node fired may fire although variations basic algorithm permit repeated firings loops graph
Nodes receiving new activation value exceeds firing threshold F marked firing next spreading activation cycle
If activation originates one node variation algorithm permits marker passing distinguish paths activation spread graph The procedure terminates either nodes fire case marker passing multiple origins node reached one path
Variations algorithm permit repeated node firings activation loops graph terminate steady activation state respect delta reached maximum number iterations exceeded

Information extraction IE task automatically extracting structured information unstructured semi structured machine readable documents
In cases activity concerns processing human language texts means natural language processing NLP
Recent activities multimedia document processing like automatic annotation content extraction images audio video documents could seen information extraction Due difficulty problem current approaches IE focus narrowly restricted domains
An example extraction newswire reports corporate mergers denoted formal relation M e r g e r B e w e e n c p n c p n e displaystyle mathrm MergerBetween company_ company_ date online news sentence Yesterday New York based Foo Inc announced acquisition Bar Corp A broad goal IE allow computation done previously unstructured data
A specific goal allow logical reasoning draw inferences based logical content input data
Structured data semantically well defined data chosen target domain interpreted respect category context
Information Extraction part greater puzzle deals problem devising automatic methods text management beyond transmission storage display
The discipline information retrieval IR developed automatic methods typically statistical flavor indexing large document collections classifying documents
Another complementary approach natural language processing NLP solved problem modelling human language processing considerable success taking account magnitude task
In terms difficulty emphasis IE deals tasks IR NLP
In terms input IE assumes existence set documents document follows template e
describes one entities events manner similar documents differing details
An example consider group newswire articles Latin American terrorism article presumed based upon one terroristic acts
We also define given IE task template set case frame hold information contained single document
For terrorism example template would slots corresponding perpetrator victim weapon terroristic act date event happened
An IE system problem required understand attack article enough find data corresponding slots template
History Information extraction dates back late early days NLP
An early commercial system mid JASPER built Reuters Carnegie Group Inc ref aim providing real time financial news financial traders Beginning IE spurred series Message Understanding Conferences
MUC competition based conference focused following domains MUC MUC Naval operations messages
MUC MUC Terrorism Latin American countries
MUC Joint ventures microelectronics domain
MUC News articles management changes
MUC Satellite launch reports Considerable support came U S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA wished automate mundane tasks performed government analysts scanning newspapers possible links terrorism
Present significance The present significance IE pertains growing amount information available unstructured form
Tim Berners Lee inventor world wide web refers existing Internet web documents advocates content made available web data
Until transpires web largely consists unstructured documents lacking semantic metadata
Knowledge contained within documents made accessible machine processing means transformation relational form marking XML tags
An intelligent agent monitoring news data feed requires IE transform unstructured data something reasoned
A typical application IE scan set documents written natural language populate database information extracted
Tasks subtasks Applying information extraction text linked problem text simplification order create structured view information present free text
The overall goal create easily machine readable text process sentences
Typical IE tasks subtasks include Template filling Extracting fixed set fields document e g
extract perpetrators victims time etc
newspaper article terrorist attack
Event extraction Given input document output zero event templates
For instance newspaper article might describe multiple terrorist attacks
Knowledge Base Population Fill database facts given set documents
Typically database form triplets entity relation entity e g
Barack Obama Spouse Michelle Obama Named entity recognition recognition known entity names people organizations place names temporal expressions certain types numerical expressions employing existing knowledge domain information extracted sentences
Typically recognition task involves assigning unique identifier extracted entity
A simpler task named entity detection aims detecting entities without existing knowledge entity instances
For example processing sentence M Smith likes fishing named entity detection would denote detecting phrase M Smith refer person without necessarily using knowledge certain M Smith might specific person sentence talking
Coreference resolution detection coreference anaphoric links text entities
In IE tasks typically restricted finding links previously extracted named entities
For example International Business Machines IBM refer real world entity
If take two sentences M Smith likes fishing
But like biking would beneficial detect referring previously detected person M Smith
Relationship extraction identification relations entities PERSON works ORGANIZATION extracted sentence Bill works IBM
PERSON located LOCATION extracted sentence Bill France

World Wide Web applications IE focus MUC conferences
The proliferation Web however intensified need developing IE systems help people cope enormous amount data available online
Systems perform IE online text meet requirements low cost flexibility development easy adaptation new domains
MUC systems fail meet criteria
Moreover linguistic analysis performed unstructured text exploit HTML XML tags layout formats available online texts
As result less linguistically intensive approaches developed IE Web using wrappers sets highly accurate rules extract particular page content
Manually developing wrappers proved time consuming task requiring high level expertise
Machine learning techniques either supervised unsupervised used induce rules automatically
Wrappers typically handle highly structured collections web pages product catalogs telephone directories
They fail however text type less structured also common Web
Recent effort adaptive information extraction motivates development IE systems handle different types text well structured almost free text common wrappers fail including mixed types
Such systems exploit shallow natural language knowledge thus also applied less structured texts
A recent development Visual Information Extraction relies rendering webpage browser creating rules based proximity regions rendered web page
This helps extracting entities complex web pages may exhibit visual pattern lack discernible pattern HTML source code

Explainable AI XAI refers methods techniques application artificial intelligence technology AI results solution understood human experts
It contrasts concept black box machine learning even designers cannot explain AI arrived specific decision
XAI implemention social right explanation The technical challenge explaining AI decisions sometimes known interpretability problem
Another consideration info besity overload information thus full transparency may always possible even required AI systems optimize behavior satisfy mathematically specified goal system chosen system designers command maximize accuracy assessing positive film reviews test dataset
The AI may learn useful general rules test set reviews containing word horrible likely negative
However may also learn inappropriate rules reviews containing Daniel Day Lewis usually positive rules may undesirable deemed likely fail generalize outside test set people consider rule cheating unfair
A human audit rules XAI get idea likely system generalize future real world data outside test set
Goals Cooperation agents case algorithms humans depends trust
If humans accept algorithmic prescriptions need trust
Incompleteness formalization trust criteria barrier straightforward optimization approaches
For reason interpretability explainability posited intermediate goals checking criteria AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks optimal job satisfying explicit pre programmed goals training data reflect complicated implicit desires human system designers
For example system tasked image recognition learned cheat looking copyright tag happened associated horse pictures rather learning tell horse actually pictured
In another system supervised learning AI tasked grasping items virtual world learned cheat placing manipulator object viewer way falsely appeared grasping object One transparency project DARPA XAI program aims produce glass box models explainable human loop without greatly sacrificing AI performance
Human users able understand AI cognition real time fact able determine trust AI AI distrusted
Other applications XAI knowledge extraction black box models model comparisons
The term glass box also used systems monitor inputs outputs system purpose verifying system adherence ethical socio legal values therefore producing value based explanations
Furthermore term used name voice assistant produces counterfactual statements explanations
History methods Mycin research prototype could explain hand coded rules contributed diagnosis specific case developed early
By researchers also began studying whether possible meaningfully extract non hand coded rules generated opaque trained neural networks
Researchers clinical expert systems creating neural network powered decision support clinicians sought develop dynamic explanations allow technologies trusted trustworthy practice
In public concerns racial bias use AI criminal sentencing decisions findings creditworthiness may led increased demand transparent artificial intelligence
As result many academics organizations developing tools help detect bias systems Marvin Minsky et al raised issue AI function form surveillance biases inherent surveillance suggesting HI Humanistic Intelligence way create fair balanced human loop AI
Modern complex AI techniques deep learning genetic algorithms naturally opaque
Nevertheless genetic programming naturally works white box
There development many new methods make new models explainable interpretable
This includes many methods Layerwise relevance propagation LRP technique determining features particular input vector contribute strongly neural network output
In addition work decision trees Bayesian networks transparent inspection

A social robot autonomous robot interacts communicates humans autonomous physical agents following social behaviors rules attached role
Like robots social robot physically embodied avatars screen synthetic social characters embodied thus distinct
Some synthetic social agents designed screen represent head face dynamically communicate users
In cases status social robot depends form body social agent body uses physical motors sensor abilities system could considered robot
Background While robots often described possessing social qualities see example tortoises developed William Grey Walter social robotics fairly recent branch robotics
Since early artificial intelligence robotics researchers developed robots explicitly engage social level
Notable researchers include Cynthia Breazeal Tony Belpaeme Aude Billard Kerstin Dautenhahn Yiannis Demiris Hiroshi Ishiguro Maja Mataric Javier Movellan Brian Scassellati Dean Weber
Also related Kansai engineering movement Japanese science technology social robotics see especially work Takayuki Kanda Hideki Kozima Hiroshi Ishiguro Micho Okada Tomio Watanabe P Ravindra S De Silva
Designing autonomous social robot particularly challenging robot needs correctly interpret people action respond appropriately currently yet possible
Moreover people interacting social robot may hold high expectancies capabilities based science fiction representations advanced social robots
As many social robots partially fully remote controlled simulate advanced capabilities
This method often covertly controlling social robot referred Mechanical Turk Wizard Oz character L Frank Baum book
Wizard Oz studies useful social robotics research evaluate people respond social robots
Definition A robot defined International Standard Organization reprogrammable multifunctional manipulator designed move material parts tools specialized devices variable programmed motions performance variety tasks
As subset robots social robots perform processes context social interaction
The nature social interactions immaterial may range relatively simple supportive tasks passing tools worker complex expressive communication collaboration assistive healthcare
Hence social robots asked work together humans collaborative workspaces
Moreover social robots start following humans much personal settings like home health care education
Social interactions likely cooperative definition limited situation
Moreover uncooperative behavior considered social certain situations
The robot could example exhibit competitive behavior within framework game
The robot could also interact minimum communication
It could example hand tools astronaut working space station
However likely communication necessary point
Two suggested ultimate requirements social robots Turing Test determine robot communication skills Isaac Asimov Three Laws Robotics behavior
The usefulness apply requirements real world application especially case Asimov laws still disputed may possible
However consequence viewpoint robot interacts communicates robots would considered social robot Being social bound humans society defines necessary social values norms standards
This results cultural dependency social robots since social values norms standards differ cultures
This brings us directly last part definition
A social robot must interact within social rules attached role
The role rules defined society
For example robotic butler humans would comply established rules good service
It anticipating reliable discreet
A social robot must aware comply
However social robots interact autonomous robots would also behave interact according non human conventions
In social robots complexity human human interaction gradually approached advancement technology androids form humanoid robots implementation variety human like communication skills Social Interaction Researches investigated user engagement robot companion
Literature present different models regarding concern
An example framework models causes effects engagement features related user non verbal behaviour task companion affective reactions predict children level engagement
Societal Impacts The increasingly widespread use advanced social robots one several phenomena expected contribute technological posthumanization human societies process society comes include members natural biological human beings one way another contribute structures dynamics meaning society Examples One well known social robots currently development Sophia developed Hanson Robotics
Sophia social humanoid robot display facial expressions first non human given United Nations title
SoftBank Robotics developed multiple social semi humanoid robots frequently used research including Pepper Nao
Pepper used commercially academically well used consumers thousand homes Japan
Other notable examples social robots include ASIMO Honda Kaspar designed University Hertfordshire help children autism learn responses robot games interactive play

Automated reasoning area cognitive science involves knowledge representation reasoning metalogic dedicated understanding different aspects reasoning
The study automated reasoning helps produce computer programs allow computers reason completely nearly completely automatically
Although automated reasoning considered sub field artificial intelligence also connections theoretical computer science even philosophy
The developed subareas automated reasoning automated theorem proving less automated pragmatic subfield interactive theorem proving automated proof checking viewed guaranteed correct reasoning fixed assumptions
Extensive work also done reasoning analogy using induction abduction Other important topics include reasoning uncertainty non monotonic reasoning
An important part uncertainty field argumentation constraints minimality consistency applied top standard automated deduction
John Pollock OSCAR system example automated argumentation system specific automated theorem prover
Tools techniques automated reasoning include classical logics calculi fuzzy logic Bayesian inference reasoning maximal entropy many less formal ad hoc techniques
Early years The development formal logic played big role field automated reasoning led development artificial intelligence
A formal proof proof every logical inference checked back fundamental axioms mathematics
All intermediate logical steps supplied without exception
No appeal made intuition even translation intuition logic routine
Thus formal proof less intuitive less susceptible logical errors Some consider Cornell Summer meeting brought together many logicians computer scientists origin automated reasoning automated deduction
Others say began Logic Theorist program Newell Shaw Simon Martin Davis implementation Presburger decision procedure proved sum two even numbers even
Automated reasoning although significant popular area research went AI winter eighties early nineties
The field subsequently revived however
For example Microsoft started using verification technology many internal projects planning include logical specification checking language version Visual C Significant contributions Principia Mathematica milestone work formal logic written Alfred North Whitehead Bertrand Russell
Principia Mathematica also meaning Principles Mathematics written purpose derive mathematical expressions terms symbolic logic
Principia Mathematica initially published three volumes Logic Theorist LT first ever program developed Allen Newell Cliff Shaw Herbert A Simon mimic human reasoning proving theorems demonstrated fifty two theorems chapter two Principia Mathematica proving thirty eight

They analyze human psychology using information science research methods artificial intelligence research probe deeper human mind Dan Curtis b
proposed AP theoretical discipline
The theory considers situation artificial intelligence approaches level complexity intelligence meets two conditions Condition I A Makes decisions autonomously B Is capable making decisions based information isNew Abstract IncompleteC The artificial intelligence capable reprogramming based new data D And capable resolving programming conflicts even presence incomplete data
This means intelligence autonomously makes value based decisions referring values intelligence created Condition II All four criteria met situations part original operating programWhen conditions met according theory possibility exists intelligence reach irrational conclusions based real created information
At point criteria met intervention necessarily resolved simple coding processes due extraordinarily complex nature codebase rather discussion intelligence format closely resembles classical human psychology
If intelligence cannot reprogrammed directly inputting new code requires intelligence reprogram process analysis decision based information provided human order overcome behavior inconsistent machines purpose ability function normally artificial psychology definition required
The level complexity required thresholds met currently subject extensive debate
The theory artificial psychology address specifics levels may level sufficiently complex intelligence cannot simply recoded software developer therefore dysfunctionality must addressed processes humans must go address dysfunctionalities
Along lines artificial psychology address question whether intelligence conscious
As level artificial intelligence approach threshold theories principles artificial psychology even tested therefore artificial psychology remains largely theoretical discipline
Even theoretical level artificial psychology advanced stage artificial intelligence

While cognitive architectures inspired neurological observation subsequently developed top manner behave manner like brain MANIC inspired common practices computer science developed bottom manner purpose unifying various methods machine learning artificial intelligence
Overview At highest level MANIC describes software agent supposedly exhibit cognitive intelligence
The agent artificial brain comprises two major components learning system decision making system
Learning system The learning system models agent environment dynamical system
It consists observation function maps agent current beliefs predicted observations transition function maps current beliefs future beliefs next time step
The observation function implemented generative deep learning architecture
It trained unsupervised manner observations agent makes
The intrinsic representations observations become agents beliefs
The transition function trained supervised manner predict next beliefs current ones
The entire learning system based loosely paper Michael S Gashler describes method training deep neural network model simple dynamical system visual observations
Decision making system The decision making system consists planning module contentment function
The planning module uses evolutionary algorithm evolve satisficing plan
The contentment function maps agent current beliefs anticipated beliefs evaluation utility state
It trained reinforcement human teacher
In order facilitate reinforcement learning MANIC provides mechanism agent generate fantasy videos show anticipated observations candidate plan executed
The idea human teacher would evaluate videos rank according desirability utility agent could use feedback refine contentment function
Sentience MANIC proposes learning system gives agent awareness environment modeling using model anticipate future beliefs
It proposes similar mechanism also implement sentience
That claims awareness implemented outward looking model sentience implemented inward looking model
Therefore proposes add introspective senses theoretically give agent ability become aware inner feelings modeling aware external environment
To extent MANIC suggests existing methods already use artificial intelligence unintentionally creating subjective experiences like typically associated conscious beings

The Combs method method writing fuzzy logic rules described William E Combs
It designed prevent combinatorial explosion fuzzy logic rules
The Combs method takes advantage logical equality p q r p r q r displaystyle p land q Rightarrow r iff p Rightarrow r lor q Rightarrow r
Equality proof The simplest proof given equality involves usage truth tables Combinatorial explosion Suppose fuzzy system considers N variables time fit least one S sets
The number rules necessary cover cases traditional fuzzy system S N displaystyle S N whereas Combs method would need S N displaystyle S times N rules
For example five sets five variables consider produce one output covering cases would require rules traditional system Combs method would require rules taming combinatorial explosion occurs inputs sets added system
This article focus Combs method
To learn way rules traditionally formed see fuzzy logic fuzzy associative matrix
Example Suppose designing artificial personality system determined friendly personality supposed towards person strategic video game
The personality would consider fear trust love person
A set rules Combs system might look like The table translates IF Fear IS Unafraid THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR IF Fear IS ModerateFear THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR IF Fear IS Afraid THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends OR IF Trust IS Distrusting THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR IF Trust IS ModerateTrust THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR IF Trust IS Trusting THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends OR IF Love IS Unloving THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR IF Love IS ModerateLove THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR IF Love IS Loving THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends In case table follows straightforward pattern output could rewritten Each column table maps output provided last row
To obtain output system average outputs rule output
For example calculate much computer Enemies player take average much computer Unafraid Distrusting Unloving player
When three averages obtained result defuzzified traditional means

A legal expert system domain specific expert system uses artificial intelligence emulate decision making abilities human expert field law
Legal expert systems employ rule base knowledge base inference engine accumulate reference produce expert knowledge specific subjects within legal domain
Purpose It suggested legal expert systems could help manage rapid expansion legal information decisions began intensify late
Many first legal expert systems created Lawyers originally identified primary target users legal expert systems
Potential motivations work included speedier delivery legal advice reduced time spent repetitive labour intensive legal tasks development knowledge management techniques dependent staff reduced overhead labour costs higher profitability law firms reduced fees clients Some early development work oriented toward creation automated judges Later work legal expert systems identified potential benefits non lawyers means increase access legal knowledge Legal expert systems also support administrative processes facilitating decision making processes automating rule based analyses exchanging information directly citizen users
Types Architectural variations Rule based expert systems rely model deductive reasoning utilizes A B rules
In rule based legal expert system information represented form deductive rules within knowledge base Case based reasoning models store manipulate examples cases hold potential emulate analogical reasoning process thought well suited legal domain
This model effectively draws known experiences outcomes similar problems A neural net relies computer model mimics structure human brain operates similar way case based reasoning model
This expert system model capable recognizing classifying patterns within realm legal knowledge dealing imprecise inputs Fuzzy logic models attempt create fuzzy concepts objects converted quantitative terms rules indexed retrieved system
In legal domain fuzzy logic used rule based case based reasoning models
Theoretical variations While legal expert system architects adopted practical approach employing scientific modes reasoning within given set rules cases others opted broader philosophical approach inspired jurisprudential reasoning modes emanating established legal theoreticians
Functional variations Some legal expert systems aim arrive particular conclusion law others designed predict particular outcome
An example predictive system one predicts outcome judicial decisions value case outcome litigation
Reception Many forms legal expert systems become widely used accepted legal community users legal services
Challenges Domain related problems The inherent complexity law discipline raises immediate challenges legal expert system knowledge engineers
Legal matters often involve interrelated facts issues compound complexity Factual uncertainty may also arise disputed versions factual representations must input expert system begin reasoning process
Computerized problem solving The limitations computerized problem solving techniques inhibit success many expert systems legal domain
Expert systems typically rely deductive reasoning models difficulty according degrees weight certain principles law importance previously decided cases may may influence decision immediate case context
Representation legal knowledge Expert legal knowledge difficult represent formalize within structure expert system
For knowledge engineers challenges include Open texture Law rarely applied exact way specific facts exact outcomes rarely certainty
Statutes may interpreted according different linguistic interpretations reliance precedent cases contextual factors including particular judge conception fairness
The balancing reasons Many arguments involve considerations reasons easily represented logical way
For instance many constitutional legal issues said balance independently well established considerations state interests individual rights
Such balancing may draw extra legal considerations would difficult represent logically expert system
Indeterminacy legal reasoning In adversarial arena law common two strong arguments single point
Determining right answer may depend majority vote among expert judges case appeal
Time cost effectiveness Creating functioning expert system requires significant investments software architecture subject matter expertise knowledge engineering
Faced challenges many system architects restrict domain terms subject matter jurisdiction
The consequence approach creation narrowly focused geographically restricted legal expert systems difficult justify cost benefit basis Current applications AI legal field utilize machines review documents particularly high level completeness confidence quality document analysis depended upon instances litigation due diligence play role

Among numerically quantifiable advantages AI legal field time money saving impact freeing lawyers spend inordinate amounts valuable time routine tasks aiding setting free lawyers creative energy reducing stress

This turn increases rate case load reduction accomplishing better results less time unlocks potential additional revenue per unit time spend case

The cost setting maintaining AI systems law offset attained savings increased efficacy unbalanced cost assigned clients

Lack correctness results decisions Legal expert systems may lead non expert users incorrect inaccurate results decisions
This problem could compounded fact users may rely heavily correctness trustworthiness results decisions generated systems
Examples ASHSD II hybrid legal expert system blends rule based case based reasoning models area matrimonial property disputes English law CHIRON hybrid legal expert system blends rule based case based reasoning models support tax planning activities United States tax law codes JUDGE rule based legal expert system deals sentencing criminal legal domain offences relating murder assault manslaughter The Latent Damage Project rule based legal expert system deals limitation periods UK Latent Damage Act relation domains tort contract product liability law Split Up rule based legal expert system assists division marital assets according Australia Family Law Act SHYSTER case based legal expert system also function hybrid ability link rule based models
It designed accommodate multiple legal domains including aspects Australian copyright law contract law personal property administrative law TAXMAN rule based system could perform basic form legal reasoning classifying cases particular category statutory rules area law concerning corporate reorganization
Controversies There may lack consensus distinguishes legal expert system knowledge based system also called intelligent knowledge based system
While legal expert systems held function level human legal expert knowledge based systems may depend ongoing assistance human expert
True legal expert systems typically focus narrow domain expertise opposed wider less specific domain case knowledge based systems Legal expert systems represent potentially disruptive technologies traditional bespoke delivery legal services
Accordingly established legal practitioners may consider threat historical business practices Arguments made failure take consideration various theoretical approaches legal decision making produce expert systems fail reflect true nature decision making
Meanwhile legal expert system architects contend many lawyers proficient legal reasoning skills without sound base legal theory hold true legal expert systems Because legal expert systems apply precision scientific rigor act legal decision making may seen challenge disorganized less precise dynamics traditional jurisprudential modes legal reasoning
Some commentators also contend true nature legal practice necessarily depend analyses legal rules principles decisions based instead expectation human adjudicator would decide given case

Emotion recognition process identifying human emotion
People vary widely accuracy recognizing emotions others
Use technology help people emotion recognition relatively nascent research area
Generally technology works best uses multiple modalities context
To date work conducted automating recognition facial expressions video spoken expressions audio written expressions text physiology measured wearables
Human Humans show great deal variability abilities recognize emotion
A key point keep mind learning automated emotion recognition several sources ground truth truth real emotion
Suppose trying recognize emotions Alex
One source would people say Alex feeling
In case truth may correspond Alex feels may correspond people would say looks like Alex feels
For example Alex may actually feel sad puts big smile people say looks happy
If automated method achieves results group observers may considered accurate even actually measure Alex truly feels
Another source truth ask Alex truly feels
This works Alex good sense internal state wants tell capable putting accurately words number
However people alexithymic good sense internal feelings able communicate accurately words numbers
In general getting truth emotion actually present take work vary depending criteria selected usually involve maintaining level uncertainty
Automatic Decades scientific research conducted developing evaluating methods automated emotion recognition
There extensive literature proposing evaluating hundreds different kinds methods leveraging techniques multiple areas signal processing machine learning computer vision speech processing
Different methodologies techniques may employed interpret emotion Bayesian networks
Gaussian Mixture models Hidden Markov Models
Approaches The accuracy emotion recognition usually improved combines analysis human expressions multimodal forms texts physiology audio video
Different emotion types detected integration information facial expressions body movement gestures speech
The technology said contribute emergence called emotional emotive Internet The existing approaches emotion recognition classify certain emotion types generally classified three main categories knowledge based techniques statistical methods hybrid approaches
Knowledge based techniques Knowledge based techniques sometimes referred lexicon based techniques utilize domain knowledge semantic syntactic characteristics language order detect certain emotion types
In approach common use knowledge based resources emotion classification process WordNet SenticNet ConceptNet EmotiNet name
One advantages approach accessibility economy brought large availability knowledge based resources
A limitation technique hand inability handle concept nuances complex linguistic rules Knowledge based techniques mainly classified two categories dictionary based corpus based approaches
Dictionary based approaches find opinion emotion seed words dictionary search synonyms antonyms expand initial list opinions emotions
Corpus based approaches hand start seed list opinion emotion words expand database finding words context specific characteristics large corpus
While corpus based approaches take account context performance still vary different domains since word one domain different orientation another domain
Statistical methods Statistical methods commonly involve use different supervised machine learning algorithms large set annotated data fed algorithms system learn predict appropriate emotion types
Machine learning algorithms generally provide reasonable classification accuracy compared approaches one challenges achieving good results classification process need sufficiently large training set Some commonly used machine learning algorithms include Support Vector Machines SVM Naive Bayes Maximum Entropy
Deep learning unsupervised family machine learning also widely employed emotion recognition
Well known deep learning algorithms include different architectures Artificial Neural Network ANN Convolutional Neural Network CNN Long Short term Memory LSTM Extreme Learning Machine ELM
The popularity deep learning approaches domain emotion recognition may mainly attributed success related applications computer vision speech recognition Natural Language Processing NLP
Hybrid approaches Hybrid approaches emotion recognition essentially combination knowledge based techniques statistical methods exploit complementary characteristics techniques
Some works applied ensemble knowledge driven linguistic elements statistical methods include sentic computing iFeel adopted concept level knowledge based resource SenticNet
The role knowledge based resources implementation hybrid approaches highly important emotion classification process
Since hybrid techniques gain benefits offered knowledge based statistical approaches tend better classification performance opposed employing knowledge based statistical methods independently
A downside using hybrid techniques however computational complexity classification process
Datasets Data integral part existing approaches emotion recognition cases challenge obtain annotated data necessary train machine learning algorithms
For task classifying different emotion types multimodal sources form texts audio videos physiological signals following datasets available HUMAINE provides natural clips emotion words context labels multiple modalities Belfast database provides clips wide range emotions TV programs interview recordings SEMAINE provides audiovisual recordings person virtual agent contains emotion annotations angry happy fear disgust sadness contempt amusement IEMOCAP provides recordings dyadic sessions actors contains emotion annotations happiness anger sadness frustration neutral state eNTERFACE provides audiovisual recordings subjects seven nationalities contains emotion annotations happiness anger sadness surprise disgust fear DEAP provides electroencephalography EEG electrocardiography ECG face video recordings well emotion annotations terms valence arousal dominance people watching film clips DREAMER provides electroencephalography EEG electrocardiography ECG recordings well emotion annotations terms valence arousal dominance people watching film clips Applications Emotion recognition used society variety reasons
Affectiva spun MIT provides artificial intelligence software makes efficient tasks previously done manually people mainly gather facial expression vocal expression information related specific contexts viewers consented share information
For example instead filling lengthy survey feel point watching educational video advertisement consent camera watch face listen say note parts experience show expressions boredom interest confusion smiling
Note imply reading innermost feelings reads express outwardly
Other uses Affectiva include helping children autism helping people blind read facial expressions helping robots interact intelligently people monitoring signs attention driving effort enhance driver safety A patent filed Snapchat describes method extracting data crowds public events performing algorithmic emotion recognition users geotagged selfies Emotient startup company applied emotion recognition reading frowns smiles expressions faces namely artificial intelligence predict attitudes actions based facial expressions
Apple bought Emotient uses emotion recognition technology enhance emotional intelligence products nViso provides real time emotion recognition web mobile applications real time API
Visage Technologies AB offers emotion estimation part Visage SDK marketing scientific research similar purposes Eyeris emotion recognition company works embedded system manufacturers including car makers social robotic companies integrating face analytics emotion recognition software well video content creators help measure perceived effectiveness short long form video creative Many products also exist aggregate information emotions communicated online including via like button presses via counts positive negative phrases text affect recognition increasingly used kinds games virtual reality educational purposes give players natural control social avatars
Subfields emotion recognition Emotion recognition probably gain best outcome applying multiple modalities combining different objects including text conversation audio video physiology detect emotions
Emotion recognition text Text data favorable research object emotion recognition free available everywhere human life
Compare types data storage text data lighter easy compress best performance due frequent repetition words characters languages
Emotions extracted two essential text forms written texts conversations dialogues
For written texts many scholars focus working sentence level extract words phrases representing emotions
Emotion recognition conversation ERC new subfield emotion recognition mining opinions participants massive conversational data social platforms Facebook Twitter YouTube others
Emotion recognition audio Different emotion recognition text vocal signals used recognition extract emotions audio
Emotion recognition video Video data combination audio data image data sometimes texts case subtitles
Therefore results emotion recognition video generally better recognition fields features put detection process
However exchange processing time may longer

Representatives Russian association artificial intelligence RAAI example V I Gorodecki doctor technical science professor SPIIRAS V N Vagin doctor technical science professor MPEI declared term incorrect suggested author use standard terminology
History While working Russian Ministry Defense O O Varlamov started developing theory rapid logical inference
He analyzing Petri nets productions construct algorithms
Generally mivar based theory represents attempt combine entity relationship models problem instance semantic networks Petri networks
The abbreviation MIVAR introduced technical term O O Varlamov Doctor Technical Science professor Bauman MSTU designate semantic unit process mathematical modeling
The term established used works
The first experimental systems operating according mivar based principles developed
Applied mivar systems introduced
Mivar Mivar smallest structural element discrete information space
Object property relation Object Property Relation VSO graph nodes concepts arcs connections concepts
Mivar space represents set axes set elements set points space set values points
A n n N displaystyle A a_ n n ldots N A displaystyle A set mivar space axis names N displaystyle N number mivar space axes Then n F n f n n n N n I n displaystyle forall a_ n exists F_ n f_ ni _ n n ldots N i_ n ldots I_ n F n displaystyle F_ n set axis n displaystyle a_ n elements n displaystyle i_ n set F n displaystyle F_ n element identifier I n F n
displaystyle I_ n F_ n
F n displaystyle F_ n sets form multidimensional space M F F F n
displaystyle M F_ times F_ times cdots times F_ n
N displaystyle i_ i_ ldots i_ N M displaystyle M displaystyle point multidimensional space N displaystyle i_ i_ ldots i_ N coordinates point displaystyle There set values multidimensional space points M displaystyle M C M c N I I n I N displaystyle C_ M c_ i_ i_ ldots i_ N mid i_ ldots I_ i_ ldots I_ ldots i_ n ldots I_ N c N displaystyle c_ i_ i_ ldots i_ N value point multidimensional space M displaystyle M value point multidimensional space N displaystyle i_ i_ ldots i_ N For every point space M displaystyle M single value C M displaystyle C_ M set value
Thus C M displaystyle C_ M set data model state changes represented multidimensional space
To implement transition multidimensional space set points values relation μ displaystyle mu introduced C x μ M x displaystyle C_ x mu M_ x M x M displaystyle M_ x subseteq M M x F x F x F N x
displaystyle M_ x F_ x times F_ x times cdots times F_ Nx
To describe data model mivar information space necessary identify three axes The axis relations O displaystyle O The axis attributes properties S displaystyle S The axis elements objects subject domain V displaystyle V These sets independent
The mivar space represented following tuple V S O displaystyle langle V S O rangle Thus mivar described V S O displaystyle VSO formula V displaystyle V denotes object thing S displaystyle S denotes properties O displaystyle O variety relations objects particular subject domain
The category Relations describe dependencies complexity level formulae logical transitions text expressions functions services computational procedures even neural networks
A wide range capabilities complicates description modeling interconnections take consideration factors
Mivar computations use mathematical logic
In simplified form represented implication form formula
The result mivar modeling represented form bipartite graph binding two sets objects source objects resultant objects
Mivar network Mivar network method representing objects subject domain processing rules form bipartite directed graph consisting objects rules A Mivar network bipartite graph described form two dimensional matrix records information subject domain current task Generally mivar networks provide formalization representation human knowledge form connected multidimensional space
That mivar network method representing piece mivar space information form bipartite directed graph
The mivar space information formed objects connections total represent data model subject domain
Connections include rules objects processing
Thus mivar network subject domain part mivar space knowledge domain
The graph consist objects variables rules procedures
First two lists made form two nonintersecting partitions list objects list rules
Objects denoted circles
Each rule mivar network extension productions hyper rules multi activators computational procedures
It proved perspective processing formalisms identical fact nodes bipartite graph denoted rectangles
Multi dimensional binary matrices Mivar networks implemented single computing systems service oriented architectures
Certain constraints restrict application particular dimension matrix linear matrix method determining logical inference path adaptive rule networks
The matrix dimension constraint due fact implementation requires sending general matrix multiple processors
Since every matrix value initially represented symbol form amount sent data crucial obtaining example rules variables
Classical mivar based method requires storing three values matrix cell value x input variable rule output variable rule The analysis possibility firing rule separated determining output variables according stages firing rule
Consequently possible use different matrices search fired rules setting values output variables
This allowsthe use multidimensional binary matrices
Binary matrix fragments occupy much less space improve possibilities applying mivar networks
Logical computational data processing To implement logical computational data processing following done
First formalized subject domain description developed
The main objects variables rules procedures specified basis mivar based approach corresponding lists objects rules formed
This formalized representation analogous bipartite logical network graph
The main stages mivar based information processing Forming subject domain matrix Working matrix designing solution algorithm task Executing computations finding solution The first stage stage synthesis conceptual subject domain model formalization form production rules transition mivar rules
Input objects rules procedures output objects
Currently stage complex requires involvement human expert develop mivar model subject domain
Automated solution algorithm construction logical inference implemented second stage
Input data algorithm construction mivar matrix subject domain description set input object variables required object variables
The solution implemented third stage
Data processing method Firstly matrix constructed
Matrix analysis determines whether successful inference path exists
Then possible logical inference paths defined last stage shortest path selected according set optimality criteria
Let displaystyle rules n displaystyle n variables included rules input variables activating output variables
Then matrix V n displaystyle V cdot n row corresponds one rules contains information variables used rule represent interconnections rules variables
In row input variables denoted x displaystyle x corresponding positions matrix output variables denoted displaystyle
All variables already obtained certain value process inference setting input data z displaystyle z
All required output variables variables obtained basis input data w displaystyle w
One row one column added matrix V displaystyle V store service information
So matrix V displaystyle V dimension n n displaystyle n times n obtained shows whole structure source rule network
The structure logical network change network rules evolutionary dynamics
Example To search logical inference path following actions implemented Known variables denoted z displaystyle z required variables denoted w row displaystyle
For example z displaystyle z denotes positions row displaystyle variable w displaystyle w denotes position n displaystyle n
The search rules fired input variables known implemented successively example top
Absent rules logical inference path exists input data refinement addition requested
Rules fired labeled corresponding place service row
For example write matrix cell illustrated cell n displaystyle n
Given several rules choice rules fire first implemented according previously determined criteria
Several rules fired simultaneously sufficient resources available
Rule procedure firing simulation implemented assigning values known variables inferred rule z displaystyle z example
A fired rule marked additionally example number convenience work
For example corresponding changes made cells n n displaystyle n n n displaystyle n
After rule firing simulation goal achievement analysis carried required value acquisition analyzed comparing special characters service row
Given least one unknown w displaystyle w value service row displaystyle logical inference path search carried
Otherwise task considered solved successfully rules fired corresponding order form logical inference path searched
The availability rules fired defining new values previous stage assessed
Absent firearable rules inference path exists actions taken analogous step
Given fireable rules inference path search continues
In example rules exist
In cell n displaystyle n number obtained indication rule fired
At next stage analogous stage rules fired rule firing simulation analogous stages necessary actions performed obtain result
Stages implemented result achieved
A path may may found
Deducibility variables cells displaystyle displaystyle obtained indication rule already fired cell n displaystyle n formed number set
After analysis service row carried shows required variables known
Thus necessary continue processing matrix V displaystyle V dimension n n displaystyle n times n
The analysis matrix demonstrates possibility rule displaystyle firing
When rule fired new values obtained required variables well
Thus required rules service row new values obtained cells matrix appears cell n displaystyle n got value z displaystyle z instead w displaystyle w cell n displaystyle n
So positive result obtained consequently logical inference path exists given input values

As subfield artificial intelligence Diagnosis concerned development algorithms techniques able determine whether behaviour system correct
If system functioning correctly algorithm able determine accurately possible part system failing kind fault facing
The computation based observations provide information current behaviour
The expression diagnosis also refers answer question whether system malfunctioning process computing answer
This word comes medical context diagnosis process identifying disease symptoms
Example An example diagnosis process garage mechanic automobile
The mechanic first try detect abnormal behavior based observations car knowledge type vehicle
If finds behavior abnormal mechanic try refine diagnosis using new observations possibly testing system discovers faulty component mechanic plays important role vehicle diagnosis
Expert diagnosis The expert diagnosis diagnosis expert system based experience system
Using experience mapping built efficiently associates observations corresponding diagnoses
The experience provided By human operator
In case human knowledge must translated computer language
By examples system behaviour
In case examples must classified correct faulty latter case type fault
Machine learning methods used generalize examples The main drawbacks methods The difficulty acquiring expertise
The expertise typically available long period use system similar systems
Thus methods unsuitable safety mission critical systems nuclear power plant robot operating space
Moreover acquired expert knowledge never guaranteed complete
In case previously unseen behaviour occurs leading unexpected observation impossible give diagnosis
The complexity learning
The line process building expert system require large amount time computer memory
The size final expert system
As expert system aims map observation diagnosis cases require huge amount storage space
The lack robustness
If even small modification made system process constructing expert system must repeated A slightly different approach build expert system model system rather directly expertise
An example computation diagnoser diagnosis discrete event systems
This approach seen model based benefits advantages suffers drawbacks expert system approach
Model based diagnosis Model based diagnosis example abductive reasoning using model system
In general works follows We model describes behaviour system artefact
The model abstraction behaviour system incomplete
In particular faulty behaviour generally little known faulty model may thus represented
Given observations system diagnosis system simulates system using model compares observations actually made observations predicted simulation
The modelling simplified following rules A b displaystyle Ab Abnormal predicate A b S I n O b displaystyle neg Ab S Rightarrow Int wedge Obs A b S I n O b displaystyle Ab S Rightarrow Int wedge Obs fault model The semantics formulae following behaviour system abnormal e
normal internal unobservable behaviour I n displaystyle Int observable behaviour O b displaystyle Obs
Otherwise internal behaviour I n displaystyle Int observable behaviour O b displaystyle Obs
Given observations O b displaystyle Obs problem determine whether system behaviour normal A b S displaystyle neg Ab S A b S displaystyle Ab S
This example abductive reasoning
Diagnosability A system said diagnosable whatever behavior system able determine without ambiguity unique diagnosis
The problem diagnosability important designing system one hand one may want reduce number sensors reduce cost hand one may want increase number sensors increase probability detecting faulty behavior
Several algorithms dealing problems exist
One class algorithms answers question whether system diagnosable another class looks sets sensors make system diagnosable optionally comply criteria cost optimization
The diagnosability system generally computed model system
In applications using model based diagnosis model already present need built scratch

Thompson sampling named William R Thompson heuristic choosing actions addresses exploration exploitation dilemma multi armed bandit problem
It consists choosing action maximizes expected reward respect randomly drawn belief
Description Consider set contexts X displaystyle mathcal X set actions A displaystyle mathcal A rewards R displaystyle mathbb R
In round player obtains context x X displaystyle x mathcal X plays action A displaystyle mathcal A receives reward r R displaystyle r mathbb R following distribution depends context issued action
The aim player play actions maximize cumulative rewards
The elements Thompson sampling follows likelihood function P r θ x displaystyle P r theta x set Θ displaystyle Theta parameters θ displaystyle theta distribution r displaystyle r prior distribution P θ displaystyle P theta parameters past observations triplets D x r displaystyle mathcal D x r posterior distribution P θ D P D θ P θ displaystyle P theta mathcal D propto P mathcal D theta P theta P D θ displaystyle P mathcal D theta likelihood function Thompson sampling consists playing action A displaystyle ast mathcal A according probability maximizes expected reward e
I E r x θ max E r x θ P θ D θ displaystyle int mathbb I left mathbb E r ast x theta max _ mathbb E r x theta right P theta mathcal D theta I displaystyle mathbb I indicator function
In practice rule implemented sampling round parameters θ displaystyle theta ast posterior P θ D displaystyle P theta mathcal D choosing action displaystyle ast maximizes E r θ x displaystyle mathbb E r theta ast ast x e
expected reward given sampled parameters action current context
Conceptually means player instantiates beliefs randomly round acts optimally according
In practical applications computationally onerous maintain sample posterior distribution models
As Thompson sampling often used conjunction approximate sampling techniques
History Thompson sampling originally described Thompson
It subsequently rediscovered numerous times independently context multi armed bandit problems
A first proof convergence bandit case shown
The first application Markov decision processes
A related approach see Bayesian control rule published
In also shown Thompson sampling instantaneously self correcting
Asymptotic convergence results contextual bandits published
Nowadays Thompson Sampling widely used many online learning problems Thompson sampling also applied A B testing website design online advertising Thompson sampling formed basis accelerated learning decentralized decision making Double Thompson Sampling D TS algorithm proposed dueling bandits variant traditional MAB feedbacks come format pairwise comparison
Relationship approaches Probability matching Probability matching decision strategy predictions class membership proportional class base rates
Thus training set positive examples observed time negative examples observed time observer using probability matching strategy predict unlabeled examples class label positive instances class label negative instances
Bayesian control rule A generalization Thompson sampling arbitrary dynamical environments causal structures known Bayesian control rule shown optimal solution adaptive coding problem actions observations
In formulation agent conceptualized mixture set behaviours
As agent interacts environment learns causal properties adopts behaviour minimizes relative entropy behaviour best prediction environment behaviour
If behaviours chosen according maximum expected utility principle asymptotic behaviour Bayesian control rule matches asymptotic behaviour perfectly rational agent
The setup follows
Let T displaystyle a_ a_ ldots a_ T actions issued agent time T displaystyle T let T displaystyle o_ o_ ldots o_ T observations gathered agent time T displaystyle T
Then agent issues action T displaystyle a_ T probability P T T T displaystyle P a_ T hat _ T o_ T hat notation displaystyle hat _ denotes fact displaystyle a_ causal intervention see Causality ordinary observation
If agent holds beliefs θ Θ displaystyle theta Theta behaviors Bayesian control rule becomes P T T T Θ P T θ T T P θ T T θ displaystyle P a_ T hat _ T o_ T int _ Theta P a_ T theta hat _ T o_ T P theta hat _ T o_ T theta P θ T T displaystyle P theta hat _ T o_ T posterior distribution parameter θ displaystyle theta given actions T displaystyle a_ T observations T displaystyle o_ T
In practice Bayesian control amounts sampling time step parameter θ displaystyle theta ast posterior distribution P θ T T displaystyle P theta hat _ T o_ T posterior distribution computed using Bayes rule considering causal likelihoods observations T displaystyle o_ o_ ldots o_ T ignoring causal likelihoods actions T displaystyle a_ a_ ldots a_ T sampling action T displaystyle a_ T ast action distribution P T θ T T displaystyle P a_ T theta ast hat _ T o_ T
Upper Confidence Bound UCB algorithms Thompson sampling upper confidence bound algorithms share fundamental property underlies many theoretical guarantees
Roughly speaking algorithms allocate exploratory effort actions might optimal sense optimistic
Leveraging property one translate regret bounds established UCB algorithms Bayesian regret bounds Thompson sampling unify regret analysis across algorithms many classes problems

Under strong mayor system mayor acts elected executive city council exercising legislative powers
They may select chief administrative officer oversee different departments

LIDA cognitive cycle The LIDA cognitive cycle subdivided three phases understanding phase attention consciousness phase action selection learning phase
Beginning understanding phase incoming stimuli activate low level feature detectors sensory memory
The output engages perceptual associative memory higher level feature detectors feed abstract entities objects categories actions events etc
The resulting percept moves Workspace cues Transient Episodic Memory Declarative Memory producing local associations
These local associations combined percept generate current situational model agent understanding going right
The attention phase begins forming coalitions salient portions current situational model compete attention place current conscious contents
These conscious contents broadcast globally initiating learning action selection phase
New entities associations reinforcement old ones occur conscious broadcast reaches various forms memory perceptual episodic procedural
In parallel learning using conscious contents possible action schemes instantiated Procedural Memory sent Action Selection compete behavior selected cognitive cycle
The selected behavior triggers sensory motor memory produce suitable algorithm execution completes cognitive cycle

A knowledge based system KBS computer program reasons uses knowledge base solve complex problems
The term broad refers many different kinds systems
The one common theme unites knowledge based systems attempt represent knowledge explicitly reasoning system allows derive new knowledge
Thus knowledge based system two distinguishing features knowledge base inference engine
The first part knowledge base represents facts world often form subsumption ontology rather implicitly embedded procedural code way conventional computer program
Other common approaches addition subsumption ontology include frames conceptual graphs logical assertions The second part inference engine allows new knowledge inferred
Most commonly take form IF THEN rules coupled forward backward chaining approaches
Other approaches include use automated theorem provers logic programming blackboard systems term rewriting systems CHR Constraint Handling Rules
These formal approaches covered detail Wikipedia article knowledge representation reasoning
Overview Knowledge based systems first developed artificial intelligence researchers
These early knowledge based systems primarily expert systems fact term often used interchangeably expert systems although difference
The difference view taken describe system expert system refers type task system trying assist replace aid human expert complex task typically viewed requiring expert knowledge knowledge based system refers architecture system represents knowledge explicitly rather procedural code While earliest knowledge based systems almost expert systems tools architectures since used whole host types systems
Virtually expert systems knowledge based systems many knowledge based systems expert systems
The first knowledge based systems rule based expert systems
One famous Mycin program medical diagnosis
These early expert systems represented facts world simple assertions flat database used rules reason result add assertions
Representing knowledge explicitly via rules several advantages Acquisition maintenance
Using rules meant domain experts could often define maintain rules rather via programmer
Explanation
Representing knowledge explicitly allowed systems reason came conclusion use information explain results users
For example follow chain inferences led diagnosis use facts explain diagnosis
Reasoning
Decoupling knowledge processing knowledge enabled general purpose inference engines developed
These systems could develop conclusions followed data set initial developers may even aware Later architectures knowledge based reasoning BB blackboard architecture blackboard system allowed reasoning process affected new inferences providing meta level reasoning
BB allowed problem solving process monitored
Different kinds problem solving e g top bottom opportunistic problem solving could selectively mixed based current state problem solving
Essentially problem solver used solve domain level problem along control problem could depend former
Other examples knowledge based system architectures supporting meta level reasoning MRS SOAR
In addition expert systems applications knowledge based systems include real time process control intelligent tutoring systems problem solvers specific domains protein structure analysis construction site layout computer system fault diagnosis
As knowledge based systems became complex techniques used represent knowledge base became sophisticated included logic term rewriting systems conceptual graphs frames
Consider frames example
Rather representing facts assertions data knowledge base become structured
Frames thought representing world knowledge using analogous techniques object oriented programming specifically use hierarchies classes subclasses relations classes behavior objects
As knowledge base became structured reasoning could occur independent rules logical inference interactions within knowledge base
For example procedures stored daemons objects could fire could replicate chaining behavior rules Another advancement development special purpose automated reasoning systems called classifiers
Rather statically declare subsumption relations knowledge base classifier allows developer simply declare facts world let classifier deduce relations
In way classifier also play role inference engine The recent advancement knowledge based systems adopt technologies especially kind logic called description logic development systems use internet
The internet often deal complex unstructured data cannot relied fit specific data model
The technology knowledge based systems especially ability classify objects demand ideal systems

Conflict resolution strategies used production systems artificial intelligence rule based expert systems help choosing production rule fire
The need strategy arises conditions two rules satisfied currently known facts
Categories Conflict resolution strategies fall several main categories
They advantages form rationales
Specificity If conditions two rules satisfied choose rule according specific conditions
It possible favor either general specific case
The specific may identified roughly one greatest number preconditions
This usefully catches exceptions special cases firing general default rules
Recency When two rules could chosen favor one matches recently added facts likely describe current situation
Not previously used If rule conditions satisfied previously rule satisfied facts ignore rule
This helps prevent system entering infinite loops
Order Pick first applicable rule order presentation
This strategy Prolog interpreters use default strategy may implemented building suitable rules Prolog system
Arbitrary choice Pick rule random
This merit simple compute

Embodied cognitive science interdisciplinary field research aim explain mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior

Turing proposed machine may need human like body think speak It also maintained best provide machine best sense organs money buy teach understand speak English
That process could follow normal teaching child
Things would pointed named etc
Again I know right answer I think approaches tried Turing
Traditional cognitive theory Embodied cognitive science alternative theory cognition minimizes appeals computational theory mind favor greater emphasis organism body determines thinks
Traditional cognitive theory based mainly around symbol manipulation certain inputs fed processing unit produces output
These inputs follow certain rules syntax processing unit finds semantic meaning
Thus appropriate output produced
For example human sensory organs input devices stimuli obtained external environment fed nervous system serves processing unit
From nervous system able read sensory information follows syntactic structure thus output created
This output creates bodily motions brings forth behavior cognition
Of particular note cognition sealed away brain meaning mental cognition cut external world possible input sensory information
The embodied cognitive approach Embodied cognitive science differs traditionalist approach denies input output system
This chiefly due problems presented Homunculus argument concluded semantic meaning could derived symbols without kind inner interpretation
If little man person head interpreted incoming symbols would interpret little man inputs
Because specter infinite regress traditionalist model began seem less plausible
Thus embodied cognitive science aims avoid problem defining cognition three ways
Physical attributes body The first aspect embodied cognition examines role physical body particularly properties affect ability think
This part attempts overcome symbol manipulation component feature traditionalist model
Depth perception instance better explained embodied approach due sheer complexity action
Depth perception requires brain detect disparate retinal images obtained distance two eyes
In addition body head cues complicate
When head turned given direction objects foreground appear move objects background
From said kind visual processing occurring without need kind symbol manipulation
This objects appearing move foreground simply appearing move
This observation concludes depth perceived intermediate symbol manipulation necessary
A poignant example exists examining auditory perception
Generally speaking greater distance ears greater possible auditory acuity
Also relevant amount density ears strength frequency wave alters passes given medium
The brain auditory system takes factors account process information without need symbolic manipulation system
This distance ears example need symbols represent
The distance creates necessary opportunity greater auditory acuity
The amount density ears similar actual amount simply forms opportunity frequency alteration
Thus consideration physical properties body symbolic system unnecessary unhelpful metaphor
The body role cognitive process The second aspect draws heavily George Lakoff Mark Johnson work concepts
They argued humans use metaphors whenever possible better explain external world
Humans also basic stock concepts concepts derived
These basic concepts include spatial orientations front back
Humans understand concepts mean directly experience bodies
For example human movement revolves around standing erect moving body motion humans innately concepts
Lakoff Johnson contend similar spatial orientations front back
As mentioned earlier basic stocks spatial concepts basis concepts constructed
Happy sad instance seen respectively
When someone says feeling really saying feel sad example
Thus point true understanding concepts contingent whether one understanding human body
So argument goes one lacked human body could possibly know could mean could relate emotional states
I magine spherical living outside gravitational field knowledge imagination kind experience
What could UP possibly mean
While mean beings would incapable expressing emotions words mean would express emotions differently humans
Human concepts happiness sadness would different human would different bodies
So organism body directly affects think uses metaphors related body basis concepts
Interaction local environment A third component embodied approach looks agents use immediate environment cognitive processing
Meaning local environment seen actual extension body cognitive process
The example personal digital assistant PDA used better imagine
Echoing functionalism philosophy mind point claims mental states individuated role much larger system
So premise information PDA similar information stored brain
So one thinks information brain constitutes mental states must follow information PDA cognitive state
Consider also role pen paper complex multiplication problem
The pen paper involved cognitive process solving problem seems ridiculous say somehow different process much way PDA used information like brain
Another example examines humans control manipulate environment cognitive tasks better performed
Leaving one car keys familiar place missed instance using landmarks navigate unfamiliar city
Thus humans incorporate aspects environment aid cognitive functioning
Examples value embodied approach The value embodiment approach context cognitive science perhaps best explained Andy Clark
He makes claim brain alone single focus scientific study cognition It increasingly clear wide variety cases individual brain sole locus cognitive scientific interest
Cognition phenomenon successfully studied marginalizing roles body world action
The following examples used Clark better illustrate embodied thinking becoming apparent scientific thinking
Bluefin tuna Thunnus tuna long baffled conventional biologists incredible abilities accelerate quickly attain great speeds
A biological examination tuna shows capable feats
However answer found taking tuna embodied state account
The bluefin tuna able take advantage exploit local environment finding naturally occurring currents increase speed
The tuna also uses physical body end well utilizing tailfin create necessary vortices pressure accelerate maintain high speeds
Thus bluefin tuna actively using local environment ends attributes physical body
Robots Clark uses example hopping robot constructed Raibert Hodgins demonstrate value embodiment paradigm
These robots essentially vertical cylinders single hopping foot
The challenge managing robot behavior daunting addition intricacies program also mechanical matters regarding foot ought constructed could hop
An embodied approach makes easier see order robot function must able exploit system fullest
That robot systems seen dynamic characteristics opposed traditional view merely command center executes actions
Vision Clark distinguishes two kinds vision animate pure vision
Pure vision idea typically associated classical artificial intelligence vision used create rich world model thought reason used fully explore inner model
In words pure vision passively creates external perceivable world faculties reason better used introspectively
Animate vision contrast sees vision means real time action commence
Animate vision vehicle visual information obtained actions undertaken
Clark points animate vision example embodiment uses biological local environment cues create active intelligent process
Consider Clark example going drugstore buy Kodak film
In one mind one familiar Kodak logo trademark gold color
Thus one uses incoming visual stimuli navigate around drugstore one finds film
Therefore vision seen passive system rather active retrieval device intelligently uses sensory information local environmental cues perform specific real world actions
Affordance Inspired work American psychologist James J Gibson next example emphasizes importance action relevant sensory information bodily movement local environment cues
These three concepts unified concept affordances possibilities action provided physical world given agent
These turn determined agent physical body capacities overall action related properties local environment well
Clark uses example outfielder baseball better illustrate concept affordance
Traditional computational models would claim outfielder attempting catch fly ball calculated variables running speed outfielder arc baseball
However Gibson work shows simpler method possible
The outfielder catch ball long adjust running speed ball continually moves straight line field vision
Note strategy uses various affordances contingent upon success outfielder including physical body composition environment baseball field sensory information obtained outfielder
Clark points latter strategy catching ball opposed former significant implications perception
The affordance approach proves non linear relies upon spontaneous real time adjustments
On contrary former method computing arc ball linear follows sequence perception calculation performing action
Thus affordance approach challenges traditional view perception arguing notion computation introspection necessary
Instead ought replaced idea perception constitutes continuous equilibrium action adjustment agent world
Ultimately Clark expressly claim certain observe affordance approach explain adaptive response satisfactorily
This utilize environmental cues made possible perceptual information actively used real time agent
General principles intelligent behavior In formation general principles intelligent behavior Pfeifer intended contrary older principles given traditional artificial intelligence
The dramatic difference principles applicable situated robotic agents real world domain traditional artificial intelligence showed least promise
Principle Cheap Design Redundancy Pfeifer realized implicit assumptions made engineers often substantially influence control architecture complexity
This insight reflected discussions scalability problem robotics
The internal processing needed bad architectures grow proportion new tasks needed agent
One primary reasons scalability problems amount programming knowledge engineering robot designers perform grows rapidly complexity robot tasks
There mounting evidence pre programming cannot solution scalability problem
The problem programmers introduce many hidden assumptions robot code
The proposed solutions agent exploit inherent physics environment exploit constraints niche agent morphology based parsimony principle Redundancy
Redundancy reflects desire error correction signals afforded duplicating like channels
Additionally reflects desire exploit associations sensory modalities
See redundant modalities
In terms design implies redundancy introduced respect one sensory modality several
It suggested fusion transfer knowledge modalities basis reducing size sense data taken real world
This addresses scalability problem
Principle Parallel Loosely coupled Processes An alternative hierarchical methods knowledge action selection
This design principle differs importantly Sense Think Act cycle traditional AI
Since involve famous cycle affected frame problem
Principle Sensory Motor Coordination Ideally internal mechanisms agent give rise things like memory choice making emergent fashion rather prescriptively programmed beginning
These kinds things allowed emerge agent interacts environment
The motto build fewer assumptions agent controller learning robust idiosyncratic future
Principle Ecological Balance This theory principle implications widespread
Its claim internal processing agent cannot made complex unless corresponding increase complexity motors limbs sensors agent
In words extra complexity added brain simple robot create discernible change behavior
The robot morphology must already contain complexity allow enough breathing room internal processing develop
The Value Principle This architecture developed Darwin III robot Gerald Edelman
It relies heavily connectionism
Critical responses Traditionalist response local environment claim A traditionalist may argue objects may used aid cognitive processes mean part cognitive system
Eyeglasses used aid visual process say part larger system would completely redefine meant visual system
However supporters embodied approach could make case objects environment play functional role mental states items counted among mental states

As well face face communication involved interacting embodied agent conducted alongside another task without distracting human participants instead improving enjoyment interaction
Furthermore use embodied presentation agent results improved recall presented information Embodied agents also provide social dimension interaction
Humans willingly ascribe social awareness computers thus interaction embodied agents follows social conventions similar human human interactions
This social interaction raises believability perceived trustworthiness agents increases user engagement system
Rickenberg Reeves found presence embodied agent website increased level user trust website also increased users anxiety affected performance watched real human
Another effect social aspect agents presentations given embodied agent perceived entertaining less difficult similar presentations given without agent
Research shows perceived enjoyment followed perceived usefulness ease use major factor influencing user adoption embodied agents A study January Byron Reeves Stanford demonstrated digital characters could enhance online experiences explaining virtual characters essentially add sense relatability user experience make approachable
This increase likability turn helps make products better benefits end users creating product
Applications The rich style communication characterises human conversation makes conversational interaction embodied conversational agents ideal many non traditional interaction tasks

EISs develop structure functionality internal knowledge representation autonomous learning data streams generated possibly unknown environment system self monitoring
EISs consider gradual development underlying fuzzy neuro fuzzy system structure differ evolutionary genetic algorithms consider phenomena chromosomes crossover mutation selection reproduction parents springs
The evolutionary fuzzy neuro systems sometimes also called evolving leads confusion
This typical first works topic late
Implementations EISs implemented example using neural networks fuzzy rule based models
The first neural networks consider evolving structure published
These later expanded N Kasabov P Angelov neuro fuzzy models
P Angelov introduced evolving fuzzy rule based systems EFSs first mathematical self learning model dynamically evolve internal structure human interpretable coined phrase EFS
Contemporarily offline incremental approach learning EIS namely EFuNN proprosed N Kasabov
P Angelov D Filev N Kasabov O Cordon organised first IEEE Symposium EFSs proceedings conference found
EFSs include formal mathematically sound learning mechanism extract streaming data
One earliest widely cited comprehensive survey EFSs done
Later comprehensive surveys EFS methods real applications done E Lughofer
Other works contributed area following years expanded evolving participatory learning evolving grammar evolving decision trees evolving human behaviour modelling self calibrating evolving sensors eSensors evolving fuzzy rule based classifiers evolving fuzzy controllers autonomous fault detectors
More recently stability evolving fuzzy rule based systems consist structure learning fuzzily weighted recursive least square parameter update method proven Rong
Generalized EFS allow rules arbitrarily rotated feature space thus improve data representability proposed significant extensions towards smartness rule bases thus termed Generalized Smart EFS allowing interpretability reducing curse dimensionality
The generalized rule structure also successfully used context evolving neuro fuzzy systems
Several facets challenges achieving transparent understandable rule bases EFS discussed E Lughofer EISs form theoretical methodological basis Autonomous Learning Machines ALMA autonomous multi model systems ALMMo well Autonomous Learning Systems
Evolving Fuzzy Rule based classifiers particular powerful new concept offers much simply incremental online classifiers cope new classes added existing classes merged
This much adapting new data samples added classification surfaces evolved
Fuzzy rule based classifiers methodological basis new approach deep learning considered form multi layered neural networks
Deep Learning offers high precision levels surpassing level human ability grabbed imagination researchers industry wider public
However number intrinsic constraints limitations
These include The black box opaque internal structure millions parameters involves ad hoc decisions number layers algorithm parameters
The requirement huge amount training data samples computational resources usually requiring GPUs HPC time usually requiring many hours training
Iterative search
Requires retraining new situations evolving
Does proven convergence stability Most limitations avoided use Deep Fuzzy Rule based Classifiers recently introduced based ALMMo achieving similar even better performance
The resulting prototype based IF THEN models fully interpretable dynamically evolving adapt quickly automatically new data patterns even new classes
They non parametric therefore training non iterative fast take milliseconds per data sample image normal laptop contrasts multiple hours current deep learning methods require training even use GPUs HPC
Moreover trained incrementally online real time
Another aspect Evolving Fuzzy Rule based classifiers proposed case multi class classification problems achieves reduction class imbalance cascadability class sub spaces increased flexibility performance adding new classes fly streaming samples

The Winograd Schema Challenge WSC test machine intelligence proposed Hector Levesque computer scientist University Toronto
Designed improvement Turing test multiple choice test employs questions specific structure instances called Winograd Schemas named Terry Winograd computer science Stanford University On surface Winograd Schema questions simply require resolution anaphora machine must identify antecedent ambiguous pronoun statement
This makes task natural language processing Levesque argues Winograd Schemas task requires use knowledge commonsense reasoning Nuance Communications announced July would sponsor annual WSC competition prize best system could match human performance
However prize longer offered
History The Winograd Schema Challenge proposed spirit Turing Test
Proposed Alan Turing Turing Test plays central role philosophy artificial intelligence
Turing proposed instead debating intelligence science AI concerned demonstrating intelligent behavior tested
But exact nature test Turing proposed come scrutiny especially since AI chat bot named Eugene claimed pass
The Winograd Schema Challenge proposed part ameliorate problems came light nature programs performed well test Turing original proposal called Imitation Game involves free flowing unrestricted conversations English human judges computer programs text channel teletype
In general machine passes test interrogators able tell difference human five minute conversation
Eugene Goostman On June computer program named Eugene Goostman declared first AI passed Turing Test competition held University Reading England
In competition Eugene able convince judges talking year old Ukrainian boy
The supposed victory machine thinks aroused controversies Turing Test
Critics claimed Eugene passed test simply fooling judge taking advantages purported identity
For example could easily skip key questions joking around changing subjects
However judge would forgive mistakes Eugene identified teenager spoke English second language
Weaknesses Turing Test The performance Eugene Goostman exhibited Turing Test problems
Levesque identifies several major issues summarized follows Deception The machine forced construct false identity part intelligence
Conversation A lot interaction may qualify legitimate conversation jokes clever asides points order without requiring intelligent reasoning
Evaluation Humans make mistakes judges often would disagree results
Winograd schemas The key factor WSC special format questions derived Winograd Schemas
Questions form may tailored require knowledge commonsense reasoning variety domains
They must also carefully written betray answers selectional restrictions statistical information words sentence
Origin The first cited example Winograd Schema reason namesake due Terry Winograd The choices feared advocated turn schema two instances The question whether pronoun refers city councilmen demonstrators switching two instances schema changes answer
The answer immediate human reader proves difficult emulate machines
Levesque argues knowledge plays central role problems answer schema understanding typical relationships behavior councilmen demonstrators
Since original proposition Winograd Schema Challenge Ernest Davis professor New York University compiled list Winograd Schemas various sources examples kinds questions appear Winograd Schema Challenge
Formal Description A Winograd Schema Challenge question consists three parts A sentence brief discourse contains following Two noun phrases semantic class male female inanimate group objects people An ambiguous pronoun may refer either noun phrases A special word alternate word special word replaced alternate word natural resolution pronoun changes
A question asking identity ambiguous pronoun Two answer choices corresponding noun phrases question A machine given problem standardized form includes answer choices thus making binary decision problem
Advantages The Winograd Schema Challenge following purported advantages Knowledge commonsense reasoning required solve
Winograd Schemas varying difficulty may designed involving anything simple cause effect relationships complex narratives events
They may constructed test reasoning ability specific domains e g social psychological spatial reasoning
There need human judges
Pitfalls One difficulty Winograd Schema Challenge development questions
They need carefully tailored ensure require commonsense reasoning solve
For example Levesque gives following example called Winograd Schema easy The answer question determined basis selectional restrictions situation pills get pregnant women women cannot carcinogenic pills
Thus answer could derived without use reasoning understanding sentences meaning necessary data selectional restrictions pregnant carcinogenic
Events In Nuance Communications sponsored annual competition offering grand prize
However prize longer offered The Twelfth International Symposium Logical Formalizations Commonsense Reasoning held March AAAI Spring Symposium Series Stanford University special focus Winograd Schema Challenge

Many real world applications fall two extremes instance text classification automatic analysis emails routing suitable department corporation require depth understanding text needs deal much larger vocabulary diverse syntax management simple queries database tables fixed schemata
Throughout years various attempts processing natural language English like sentences presented computers taken place varying degrees complexity
Some attempts resulted systems deep understanding helped overall system usability
For example Wayne Ratliff originally developed Vulcan program English like syntax mimic English speaking computer Star Trek
Vulcan later became dBase system whose easy use syntax effectively launched personal computer database industry
Systems easy use English like syntax however quite distinct systems use rich lexicon include internal representation often first order logic semantics natural language sentences
Hence breadth depth understanding aimed system determine complexity system implied challenges types applications deal
The breadth system measured sizes vocabulary grammar
The depth measured degree understanding approximates fluent native speaker
At narrowest shallowest English like command interpreters require minimal complexity small range applications
Narrow deep systems explore model mechanisms understanding still limited application
Systems attempt understand contents document news release beyond simple keyword matching judge suitability user broader require significant complexity still somewhat shallow
Systems broad deep beyond current state art
Components architecture Regardless approach used natural language understanding systems share common components
The system needs lexicon language parser grammar rules break sentences internal representation
The construction rich lexicon suitable ontology requires significant effort e g Wordnet lexicon required many person years effort The system also needs theory semantics guide comprehension
The interpretation capabilities language understanding system depend semantic theory uses
Competing semantic theories language specific trade offs suitability basis computer automated semantic interpretation
These range naive semantics stochastic semantic analysis use pragmatics derive meaning context
Semantic parsers convert natural language texts formal meaning representations Advanced applications natural language understanding also attempt incorporate logical inference within framework
This generally achieved mapping derived meaning set assertions predicate logic using logical deduction arrive conclusions
Therefore systems based functional languages Lisp need include subsystem represent logical assertions logic oriented systems using language Prolog generally rely extension built logical representation framework The management context natural language understanding present special challenges
A large variety examples counter examples resulted multiple approaches formal modeling context specific strengths weaknesses

Action selection way characterizing basic problem intelligent systems next
In artificial intelligence computational cognitive science action selection problem typically associated intelligent agents animats artificial systems exhibit complex behaviour agent environment
The term also sometimes used ethology animal behavior
One problem understanding action selection determining level abstraction used specifying act
At basic level abstraction atomic act could anything contracting muscle cell provoking war
Typically one action selection mechanism set possible actions predefined fixed
Most researchers working field place high demands agents The acting agent typically must select action dynamic unpredictable environments
The agents typically act real time therefore must make decisions timely fashion
The agents normally created perform several different tasks
These tasks may conflict resource allocation e g
agent put fire deliver cup coffee time
The environment agents operate may include humans may make things difficult agent either intentionally attempting assist
The agents often intended model animals humans animal human behaviour quite complicated For reasons action selection trivial attracts good deal research
Characteristics action selection problem The main problem action selection complexity
Since computation takes time space memory agents cannot possibly consider every option available every instant time
Consequently must biased constrain search way
For AI question action selection best way constrain search
For biology ethology question various types animals constrain search
Do animals use approaches
Why use ones
One fundamental question action selection whether really problem agent whether description emergent property intelligent agent behavior
However consider going build intelligent agent becomes apparent must mechanism action selection
This mechanism may highly distributed case distributed organisms social insect colonies slime mold may special purpose module
The action selection mechanism ASM determines agent actions terms impact world also directs perceptual attention updates memory
These egocentric sorts actions may turn result modifying agent basic behavioural capacities particularly updating memory implies form machine learning possible
Ideally action selection also able learn adapt many problems combinatorial complexity computational tractability may require restricting search space learning
In AI ASM also sometimes either referred agent architecture thought substantial part one
AI mechanisms Generally artificial action selection mechanisms divided several categories symbol based systems sometimes known classical planning distributed solutions reactive dynamic planning
Some approaches fall neatly one categories
Others really providing scientific models practical AI control last described next section
Symbolic approaches Early history artificial intelligence assumed best way agent choose next would compute probably optimal plan execute plan
This led physical symbol system hypothesis physical agent manipulate symbols necessary sufficient intelligence
Many software agents still use approach action selection
It normally requires describing sensor readings world ones actions one goals form predicate logic
Critics approach complain slow real time planning despite proofs still unlikely produce optimal plans reducing descriptions reality logic process prone errors
Satisficing decision making strategy attempts meet criteria adequacy rather identify optimal solution
A satisficing strategy may often fact near optimal costs decision making process cost obtaining complete information considered outcome calculus
Goal driven architectures In symbolic architectures agent behaviour typically described set goals
Each goal achieved process activity described prescripted plan
The agent must decide process carry accomplish given goal
The plan expand subgoals makes process slightly recursive
Technically less plans exploits condition rules
These architectures reactive hybrid
Classical examples goal driven architectures implementable refinements belief desire intention architecture like JAM IVE
Distributed approaches In contrast symbolic approach distributed systems action selection actually one box agent decides next action
At least idealized form distributed systems many modules running parallel determining best action based local expertise
In idealized systems overall coherence expected emerge somehow possibly careful design interacting components
This approach often inspired artificial neural networks research
In practice almost always centralised system determining module active salience
There evidence real biological brains also executive decision systems evaluate competing systems deserves attention properly desired actions disinhibited
ASMO attention based architecture developed Rony Novianto
It orchestrates diversity modular distributed processes use representations techniques perceive environment process information plan actions propose actions perform
Various types winner take architectures single selected action takes full control motor system Spreading activation including Maes Nets ANA Extended Rosenblatt Payton spreading activation architecture developed Toby Tyrrell
The agent behaviour stored form hierarchical connectionism network Tyrrell named free flow hierarchy
Recently exploited example de Sevin Thalmann Kadleček

Dynamic planning approaches Because purely distributed systems difficult construct many researchers turned using explicit hard coded plans determine priorities system
Dynamic reactive planning methods compute one next action every instant based current context pre scripted plans
In contrast classical planning methods reactive dynamic approaches suffer combinatorial explosion
On hand sometimes seen rigid considered strong AI since plans coded advance
At time natural intelligence rigid contexts although fluid able adapt others
Example dynamic planning mechanisms include Finite state machines These reactive architectures used mostly computer game agents particular first person shooters bots virtual movie actors
Typically state machines hierarchical
For concrete game examples see Halo bots paper Damian Isla Master Thesis Quake III bots Jan Paul van Waveren
For movie example see Softimage
Other structured reactive plans tend look little like conventional plans often ways represent hierarchical sequential structure
Some PRS acts support partial plans
Many agent architectures mid included plans middle layer provided organization low level behavior modules directed higher level real time planner
Despite supposed interoperability automated planners structured reactive plans hand coded Bryson ch

Examples structured reactive plans include James Firby RAP System Nils Nilsson Teleo reactive plans
PRS RAPs TRP longer developed supported
One still active descendant approach Parallel rooted Ordered Slip stack Hierarchical POSH action selection system part Joanna Bryson Behaviour Oriented Design Sometimes attempt address perceived inflexibility dynamic planning hybrid techniques used
In conventional AI planning system searches new plans agent spare time updates dynamic plan library finds good solutions
The important aspect system agent needs select action solution exists used immediately see anytime algorithm
Others CogniTAO decision making engine based BDI belief desire intention includes built teamwork capabilities
Soar symbolic cognitive architecture
It based condition action rules known productions
Programmers use Soar development toolkit building reactive planning agents compromise two extremes
Excalibur research project led Alexander Nareyek featuring time planning agents computer games
The architecture based structural constraint satisfaction advanced artificial intelligence technique
ACT R similar Soar
It includes Bayesian learning system help prioritize productions
ABL Hap Fuzzy architectures The Fuzzy approach action selection produces smooth behaviour produced architectures exploiting boolean condition action rules like Soar POSH
These architectures mostly reactive symbolic
Theories action selection nature Many dynamic models artificial action selection originally inspired research ethology
In particular Konrad Lorenz Nikolaas Tinbergen provided idea innate releasing mechanism explain instinctive behaviors fixed action patterns
Influenced ideas William McDougall Lorenz developed psychohydraulic model motivation behavior
In ethology ideas influential regarded outdated use energy flow metaphor nervous system control behavior normally treated involving information transmission rather energy flow
Dynamic plans neural networks similar information transmission spreading activation similar diffuse control emotional hormonal systems
Stan Franklin proposed action selection right perspective take understanding role evolution mind

Backward chaining backward reasoning inference method described colloquially working backward goal
It used automated theorem provers inference engines proof assistants artificial intelligence applications In game theory researchers apply simpler subgames find solution game process called backward induction
In chess called retrograde analysis used generate table bases chess endgames computer chess
Backward chaining implemented logic programming SLD resolution
Both rules based modus ponens inference rule
It one two commonly used methods reasoning inference rules logical implications forward chaining
Backward chaining systems usually employ depth first search strategy e g
Prolog
How works Backward chaining starts list goals hypothesis works backwards consequent antecedent see data supports consequents
An inference engine using backward chaining would search inference rules finds one consequent Then clause matches desired goal
If antecedent If clause rule known true added list goals one goal confirmed one must also provide data confirms new rule
For example suppose new pet Fritz delivered opaque box along two facts Fritz Fritz croaks Fritz eats fliesThe goal decide whether Fritz green based rule base containing following four rules If X croaks X eats flies Then X frog If X chirps X sings Then X canary If X frog Then X green If X canary Then X yellowWith backward reasoning inference engine determine whether Fritz green four steps
To start query phrased goal assertion proved Fritz green

Fritz substituted X rule see consequent matches goal rule becomes If Fritz frog Then Fritz green Since consequent matches goal Fritz green rules engine needs see antecedent Fritz frog proved
The antecedent therefore becomes new goal Fritz frog
Again substituting Fritz X rule becomes If Fritz croaks Fritz eats flies Then Fritz frog Since consequent matches current goal Fritz frog inference engine needs see antecedent Fritz croaks eats flies proved
The antecedent therefore becomes new goal Fritz croaks Fritz eats flies
Since goal conjunction two statements inference engine breaks two sub goals must proved Fritz croaks Fritz eats flies
To prove sub goals inference engine sees sub goals given initial facts
Therefore conjunction true Fritz croaks Fritz eats flies therefore antecedent rule true consequent must true Fritz frog therefore antecedent rule true consequent must true Fritz green This derivation therefore allows inference engine prove Fritz green
Rules used
Note goals always match affirmed versions consequents implications negated versions modus tollens even antecedents considered new goals conclusions affirming consequent ultimately must match known facts usually defined consequents whose antecedents always true thus inference rule used modus ponens
Because list goals determines rules selected used method called goal driven contrast data driven forward chaining inference
The backward chaining approach often employed expert systems
Programming languages Prolog Knowledge Machine ECLiPSe support backward chaining within inference engines

Content based image retrieval also known query image content QBIC content based visual information retrieval CBVIR application computer vision techniques image retrieval problem problem searching digital images large databases see survey recent scientific overview CBIR field
Content based image retrieval opposed traditional concept based approaches see Concept based image indexing
Content based means search analyzes contents image rather metadata keywords tags descriptions associated image
The term content context might refer colors shapes textures information derived image
CBIR desirable searches rely purely metadata dependent annotation quality completeness
Having humans manually annotate images entering keywords metadata large database time consuming may capture keywords desired describe image
The evaluation effectiveness keyword image search subjective well defined
In regard CBIR systems similar challenges defining success
Keywords also limit scope queries set predetermined criteria
set less reliable using content
History The term content based image retrieval seems originated used Japanese Electrotechnical Laboratory engineer Toshikazu Kato describe experiments automatic retrieval images database based colors shapes present
Since term used describe process retrieving desired images large collection basis syntactical image features
The techniques tools algorithms used originate fields statistics pattern recognition signal processing computer vision Content based video browsing introduced Iranian engineer Farshid Arman Taiwanese computer scientist Arding Hsu computer scientist Ming Yee Chiu working Siemens presented ACM International Conference August
They described shot detection algorithm compressed video originally encoded discrete cosine transform DCT video coding standards JPEG MPEG H x
The basic idea since DCT coefficients mathematically related spatial domain represent content frame used detect differences video frames
In algorithm subset blocks frame subset DCT coefficients block used motion vector representation frame
By operating compressed DCT representations algorithm significantly reduces computational requirements decompression enables effective video browsing
The algorithm represents separate shots video sequence r frame thumbnail shot framed motion tracking region
A variation concept later adopted QBIC video content mosaics r frame salient still shot represents
QBIC Query By Image Content The earliest commercial CBIR system developed IBM called QBIC Query By Image Content
Recent network graph based approaches presented simple attractive alternative existing methods While storing multiple images part single entity preceded term BLOB Binary Large OBject ability fully search content rather description await IBM QBIC
Technical progress The interest CBIR grown limitations inherent metadata based systems well large range possible uses efficient image retrieval
Textual information images easily searched using existing technology requires humans manually describe image database
This impractical large databases images generated automatically e g
surveillance cameras
It also possible miss images use different synonyms descriptions
Systems based categorizing images semantic classes like cat subclass animal avoid miscategorization problem require effort user find images might cats classified animal
Many standards developed categorize images still face scaling miscategorization issues Initial CBIR systems developed search databases based image color texture shape properties
After systems developed need user friendly interfaces became apparent
Therefore efforts CBIR field started include human centered design tried meet needs user performing search
This typically means inclusion query methods may allow descriptive semantics queries may involve user feedback systems may include machine learning systems may understand user satisfaction levels
Techniques Many CBIR systems developed problem retrieving images basis pixel content remains largely unsolved Different query techniques implementations CBIR make use different types user queries
Query By Example QBE Query By Example query technique involves providing CBIR system example image base search upon
The underlying search algorithms may vary depending application result images share common elements provided example
Options providing example images system include A preexisting image may supplied user chosen random set
The user draws rough approximation image looking example blobs color general shapes This query technique removes difficulties arise trying describe images words
Semantic retrieval Semantic retrieval starts user making request like find pictures Abraham Lincoln
This type open ended task difficult computers perform Lincoln may always facing camera pose
Many CBIR systems therefore generally make use lower level features like texture color shape
These features either used combination interfaces allow easier input criteria databases already trained match features faces fingerprints shape matching
However general image retrieval requires human feedback order identify higher level concepts
Relevance feedback human interaction Combining CBIR search techniques available wide range potential users intent difficult task
An aspect making CBIR successful relies entirely ability understand user intent
CBIR systems make use relevance feedback user progressively refines search results marking images results relevant relevant neutral search query repeating search new information
Examples type interface developed
Iterative machine learning Machine learning application iterative techniques becoming common CBIR
Other query methods Other query methods include browsing example images navigating customized hierarchical categories querying image region rather entire image querying multiple example images querying visual sketch querying direct specification image features multimodal queries e g
combining touch voice etc
Content comparison using image distance measures The common method comparing two images content based image retrieval typically example image image database using image distance measure
An image distance measure compares similarity two images various dimensions color texture shape others
For example distance signifies exact match query respect dimensions considered
As one may intuitively gather value greater indicates various degrees similarities images
Search results sorted based distance queried image
Many measures image distance Similarity Models developed
Color Computing distance measures based color similarity achieved computing color histogram image identifies proportion pixels within image holding specific values
Examining images based colors contain one widely used techniques completed without regard image size orientation
However research also attempted segment color proportion region spatial relationship among several color regions
Texture Texture measures look visual patterns images spatially defined
Textures represented texels placed number sets depending many textures detected image
These sets define texture also image texture located Texture difficult concept represent
The identification specific textures image achieved primarily modeling texture two dimensional gray level variation
The relative brightness pairs pixels computed degree contrast regularity coarseness directionality may estimated
The problem identifying patterns co pixel variation associating particular classes textures silky rough
Other methods classifying textures include Co occurrence matrix Laws texture energy Wavelet transform Orthogonal transforms Discrete Tchebichef moments Shape Shape refer shape image shape particular region sought
Shapes often determined first applying segmentation edge detection image
Other methods use shape filters identify given shapes image
Shape descriptors may also need invariant translation rotation scale Some shape descriptors include Fourier transform Moment invariant Image retrieval evaluation Measures image retrieval defined terms precision recall
However methods considered
Image retrieval CBIR system simultaneously different techniques An image retrieved CBIR system adopting several techniques simultaneously Integrating Pixel Cluster Indexing histogram intersection discrete wavelet transform methods

In algorithmic information theory algorithmic probability also known Solomonoff probability mathematical method assigning prior probability given observation
It invented Ray Solomonoff
It used inductive inference theory analyses algorithms
In general theory inductive inference Solomonoff uses prior obtained formula Bayes rule prediction In mathematical formalism used observations form finite binary strings universal prior probability distribution set finite binary strings
The prior universal Turing computability sense e
string zero probability
It computable approximated
Overview Algorithmic probability deals following questions Given body data phenomenon want understand select probable hypothesis caused among possible hypotheses evaluate different hypotheses
How predict future data measure likelihood prediction right one
Four principal inspirations Solomonoff algorithmic probability Occam razor Epicurus principle multiple explanations modern computing theory e g
use universal Turing machine Bayes rule prediction Occam razor Epicurus principle essentially two different non mathematical approximations universal prior
Occam razor among theories consistent observed phenomena one select simplest theory Epicurus principle multiple explanations one theory consistent observations keep theories At heart universal prior abstract model computer universal Turing machine
Any abstract computer long Turing complete e
every finite binary string least one program compute abstract computer
The abstract computer used give precise meaning phrase simple explanation
In formalism used explanations theories phenomena computer programs generate observation strings run abstract computer
A simple explanation short computer program
A complex explanation long computer program
Simple explanations likely high probability observation string one generated short computer program perhaps large number slightly longer computer programs
A low probability observation string one generated long computer program
These ideas made specific probabilities used construct prior probability distribution given observation
Solomonoff main reason inventing prior used Bayes rule actual prior unknown enabling prediction uncertainty
It predicts likely continuation observation provides measure likely continuation Although universal probability observation extension incomputable computer algorithm Levin Search run longer longer periods time generate sequence approximations converge universal probability distribution Solomonoff proved distribution machine invariant within constant factor called invariance theorem Solomonoff invented concept algorithmic probability associated invariance theorem around publishing report A Preliminary Report General Theory Inductive Inference
He clarified ideas fully A Formal Theory Inductive Inference Part I Part II
Further discussion Solomonoff described universal computer randomly generated input program
The program computes possibly infinite output
The universal probability distribution probability distribution possible output strings random input The algorithmic probability given finite output prefix q sum probabilities programs compute something starting q
Certain long objects short programs high probability
Algorithmic probability main ingredient Solomonoff theory inductive inference theory prediction based observations invented goal using machine learning given sequence symbols one come next
Solomonoff theory provides answer optimal certain sense although incomputable
Unlike example Karl Popper informal inductive inference theory Solomonoff mathematically rigorous
Algorithmic probability closely related concept Kolmogorov complexity
Kolmogorov introduction complexity motivated information theory problems randomness Solomonoff introduced algorithmic complexity different reason inductive reasoning
A single universal prior probability substituted actual prior probability Bayes rule invented Solomonoff Kolmogorov complexity side product Solomonoff enumerable measure universal certain powerful sense computation time infinite

Instrumental convergence hypothetical tendency sufficiently intelligent agents pursue potentially unbounded instrumental goals self preservation resource acquisition provided ultimate goals unbounded
Instrumental convergence suggests intelligent agent unbounded apparently harmless goals act surprisingly harmful ways
For example computer sole unconstrained goal solving Riemann hypothesis could attempt turn entire Earth computronium effort increase computing power succeed calculations Proposed basic AI drives include utility function goal content integrity self protection freedom interference self improvement non satiable acquisition additional resources
Instrumental final goals Final goals final values intrinsically valuable intelligent agent whether artificial intelligence human end
In contrast instrumental goals instrumental values valuable agent means toward accomplishing final goals
The contents tradeoffs completely rational agent final goal system principle formalized utility function
Hypothetical examples convergence One hypothetical example instrumental convergence provided Riemann hypothesis catastrophe
Marvin Minsky co founder MIT AI laboratory suggested artificial intelligence designed solve Riemann hypothesis might decide take Earth resources build supercomputers help achieve goal
If computer instead programmed produce many paper clips possible would still decide take Earth resources meet final goal
Even though two final goals different produce convergent instrumental goal taking Earth resources
Paperclip maximizer The paperclip maximizer thought experiment described Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom
It illustrates existential risk artificial general intelligence may pose human beings programmed pursue even seemingly harmless goals necessity incorporating machine ethics artificial intelligence design
The scenario describes advanced artificial intelligence tasked manufacturing paperclips
If machine programmed value human life use designated resources bounded time given enough power optimized goal would turn matter universe including human beings either paperclips machines manufacture paperclips
Suppose AI whose goal make many paper clips possible
The AI realize quickly would much better humans humans might decide switch
Because humans would fewer paper clips
Also human bodies contain lot atoms could made paper clips
The future AI would trying gear towards would one lot paper clips humans
Bostrom emphasised believe paperclip maximiser scenario per se actually occur rather intention illustrate dangers creating superintelligent machines without knowing safely program eliminate existential risk human beings
The paperclip maximizer example illustrates broad problem managing powerful systems lack human values
Basic AI drives Steve Omohundro itemized several convergent instrumental goals including self preservation self protection utility function goal content integrity self improvement resource acquisition
He refers basic AI drives
A drive denotes tendency present unless specifically counteracted different psychological term drive denoting excitatory state produced homeostatic disturbance
A tendency person fill income tax forms every year drive Omohundro sense psychological sense
Daniel Dewey Machine Intelligence Research Institute argues even initially introverted self rewarding AGI may continue acquire free energy space time freedom interference ensure stopped self rewarding
Goal content integrity In humans maintenance final goals explained thought experiment
Suppose man named Gandhi pill took would cause want kill people
This Gandhi currently pacifist one explicit final goals never kill anyone
Gandhi likely refuse take pill Gandhi knows future wants kill people likely actually kill people thus goal killing people would satisfied However cases people seem happy let final values drift
Humans complicated goals inconsistent unknown even
In artificial intelligence In Jürgen Schmidhuber concluded setting agents search proofs possible self modifications rewrites utility function happen Gödel machine first prove rewrite useful according present utility function
An analysis Bill Hibbard different scenario similarly consistent maintenance goal content integrity
Hibbard also argues utility maximizing framework goal maximizing expected utility instrumental goals called unintended instrumental actions
Resource acquisition Many instrumental goals resource acquisition valuable agent increase freedom action For almost open ended non trivial reward function set goals possessing resources equipment raw materials energy enable AI find optimal solution
Resources benefit AIs directly able create whatever stuff reward function values The AI neither hates loves made atoms use something else
In addition almost AIs benefit resources spend instrumental goals self preservation
Cognitive enhancement If agent final goals fairly unbounded agent position become first superintelligence thereby obtain decisive strategic advantage according preferences
At least special case rational intelligent agent would place high instrumental value cognitive enhancement Technological perfection Many instrumental goals technological advancement valuable agent increase freedom action
Self preservation Many instrumental goals self preservation valuable agent increase freedom action
Instrumental convergence thesis The instrumental convergence thesis outlined philosopher Nick Bostrom states Several instrumental values identified convergent sense attainment would increase chances agent goal realized wide range final goals wide range situations implying instrumental values likely pursued broad spectrum situated intelligent agents
The instrumental convergence thesis applies instrumental goals intelligent agents may wide variety possible final goals
Note Bostrom Orthogonality Thesis final goals highly intelligent agents may well bounded space time resources well bounded ultimate goals general engender unbounded instrumental goals
Impact Agents acquire resources trade conquest
A rational agent definition choose whatever option maximize implicit utility function therefore rational agent trade subset another agent resources outright seizing resources risky costly compared gains taking resources element utility function bars seizure
In case powerful self interested rational superintelligence interacting lesser intelligence peaceful trade rather unilateral seizure seems unnecessary suboptimal therefore unlikely Some observers Skype Jaan Tallinn physicist Max Tegmark believe basic AI drives unintended consequences superintelligent AI programmed well meaning programmers could pose significant threat human survival especially intelligence explosion abruptly occurs due recursive self improvement
Since nobody knows predict beforehand superintelligence arrive observers call research friendly artificial intelligence possible way mitigate existential risk artificial general intelligence

A clinical decision support system CDSS health information technology system designed provide physicians health professionals clinical decision support CDS assistance clinical decision making tasks
A working definition proposed Robert Hayward Centre Health Evidence Clinical decision support systems link health observations health knowledge influence health choices clinicians improved health care
CDSSs constitute major topic artificial intelligence medicine
Characteristics A clinical decision support system defined active knowledge systems use two items patient data generate case specific advice
This implies CDSS simply decision support system focused using knowledge management way achieve clinical advice patient care based multiple items patient data
Purpose The main purpose modern CDSS assist clinicians point care
This means clinicians interact CDSS help analyse reach diagnosis based patient data
In early days CDSSs conceived used literally make decisions clinician
The clinician would input information wait CDSS output right choice clinician would simply act output
However modern methodology using CDSSs assist means clinician interacts CDSS utilizing knowledge CDSS make better analysis patient data either human CDSS could make
Typically CDSS makes suggestions clinician look clinician expected pick useful information presented results discount erroneous CDSS suggestions The two main types CDSS knowledge based non knowledge based An example clinical decision support system might used clinician diagnosis decision support system
A DDSS requests patients data response proposes set appropriate diagnoses
The pysician takes output DDSS determines diagnoses might relevant necessary orders tests narrow diagnosis
Another example CDSS would case based reasoning CBR system
A CBR system might use previous case data help determine appropriate amount beams optimal beam angles use radiotherapy brain cancer patients medical physicists oncologists would review recommended treatment plan determine viability Another important classification CDSS based timing use
Physicians use systems point care help dealing patient timing use either pre diagnosis diagnosis post diagnosis
Pre diagnosis CDSS systems used help physician prepare diagnoses
CDSS used diagnosis help review filter physician preliminary diagnostic choices improve final results
Post diagnosis CDSS systems used mine data derive connections patients past medical history clinical research predict future events
As claimed decision support begin replace clinicians common tasks future Another approach used National Health Service England use DDSS either past operated patient today phone operative medically trained triage medical conditions hours suggesting suitable next step patient e g
call ambulance see general practitioner next working day
The suggestion may disregarded either patient phone operative common sense caution suggests otherwise based known information implicit conclusion worst case diagnosis likely always revealed patient might well incorrect based medically trained person opinion used initial triage purposes
Knowledge based CDSS Most CDSSs consist three parts knowledge base inference engine mechanism communicate
The knowledge base contains rules associations compiled data often take form IF THEN rules
If system determining drug interactions rule might IF drug X taken AND drug Y taken THEN alert user
Using another interface advanced user could edit knowledge base keep date new drugs
The inference engine combines rules knowledge base patient data
The communication mechanism allows system show results user well input system An expression language GELLO CQL Clinical Quality Language needed expressing knowledge artifacts computable manner
For example patient diabetes mellitus last hemoglobin A c test result less recommend testing months last test result greater equal recommend testing months
The current focus HL CDS WG build Clinical Quality Language CQL
CMS announced plans use CQL specification eCQMs https ecqi healthit gov cql
Non knowledge based CDSS CDSSs use knowledge base use form artificial intelligence called machine learning allow computers learn past experiences find patterns clinical data
This eliminates need writing rules expert input
However since systems based machine learning cannot explain reasons conclusions clinicians use directly diagnoses reliability accountability reasons
Nevertheless useful post diagnostic systems suggesting patterns clinicians look depth
As three types non knowledge based systems support vector machines artificial neural networks genetic algorithms
Artificial neural networks use nodes weighted connections analyse patterns found patient data derive associations symptoms diagnosis
Genetic algoriths based simplified evolutionary processes using directed selection achieve optimal CDSS results
The selection algorithms evaluate components random sets solutions problem
The solutions come top recombined mutated run process
This happens proper solution discovered
They functionally similar neural networks also black boxes attempt derive knowledge patient data
Non knowledge based networks often focus narrow list symptoms symptoms single disease opposed knowledge based approach cover diagnosis many different diseases
Regulations United States With enactment American Recovery Reinvestment Act ARRA push widespread adoption health information technology Health Information Technology Economic Clinical Health Act HITECH
Through initiatives hospitals clinics integrating electronic medical records EMRs computerized physician order entry CPOE within health information processing storage
Consequently Institute Medicine IOM promoted usage health information technology including clinical decision support systems advance quality patient care
The IOM published report To Err Human focused patient safety crisis United States pointing incredibly high number deaths
This statistic attracted great attention quality patient care With enactment HITECH Act included ARRA encouraging adoption health IT detailed case laws CDSS EMRs still defined Office National Coordinator Health Information Technology ONC approved Department Health Human Services HHS
A definition Meaningful use yet published Despite absence laws CDSS vendors would almost certainly viewed legal duty care patients may adversely affected due CDSS usage clinicians may use technology patient care
However duties care legal regulations explicitly defined yet
With recent effective legislations related performance shift payment incentives CDSS becoming attractive
Effectiveness The evidence effectiveness CDSS mixed
A systematic review find benefit terms risk death CDSS combined electronic health record
There may benefits however terms outcomes A systematic review concluded CDSSs improved practitioner performance studies patient outcomes studies
CDSSs features associated improved practitioner performance included automatic electronic prompts rather requiring user activation system A systematic review found Decision support systems significantly improved clinical practice trials
The CDSS features associated success included integration clinical workflow rather separate log screen electronic rather paper based templates providing decision support time location care rather prior providing recommendations care However later systematic reviews less optimistic effects CDS one stating There large gap postulated empirically demonstrated benefits CDSS eHealth technologies cost effectiveness yet demonstrated A year evaluation effectiveness CDSS implementing rational treatment bacterial infections published according authors first long term study CDSS
Challenges adoption Clinical challenges Much effort put forth many medical institutions software companies produce viable CDSSs support aspects clinical tasks
However complexity clinical workflows demands staff time high care must taken institution deploying support system ensure system becomes fluid integral part clinical workflow
Some CDSSs met varying amounts success others suffered common problems preventing reducing successful adoption acceptance
Two sectors healthcare domain CDSSs large impact pharmacy billing sectors
There commonly used pharmacy prescription ordering systems perform batch based checking orders negative drug interactions report warnings ordering professional
Another sector success CDSS billing claims filing
Since many hospitals rely Medicare reimbursements stay operation systems created help examine proposed treatment plan current rules Medicare order suggest plan attempts address care patient financial needs institution Other CDSSs aimed diagnostic tasks found success often limited deployment scope
The Leeds Abdominal Pain System went operational University Leeds hospital reported produced correct diagnosis cases compared clinicians success rate Despite wide range efforts institutions produce use systems widespread adoption acceptance still yet achieved offerings
One large roadblock acceptance historically workflow integration
A tendency focus functional decision making core CDSS existed causing deficiency planning clinician actually use product situ
Often CDSSs stand alone applications requiring clinician cease working current system switch CDSS input necessary data even already inputted another system examine results produced
The additional steps break flow clinician perspective cost precious time
Technical challenges barriers implementation Clinical decision support systems face steep technical challenges number areas
Biological systems profoundly complicated clinical decision may utilize enormous range potentially relevant data
For example electronic evidence based medicine system may potentially consider patient symptoms medical history family history genetics well historical geographical trends disease occurrence published clinical data medicinal effectiveness recommending patient course treatment
Clinically large deterrent CDSS acceptance workflow integration
Another source contention many medical support systems produce massive number alerts
When systems produce high volume warnings especially require escalation aside annoyance clinicians may pay less attention warnings causing potentially critical alerts missed
Maintenance One core challenges facing CDSS difficulty incorporating extensive quantity clinical research published ongoing basis
In given year tens thousands clinical trials published
Currently one studies must manually read evaluated scientific legitimacy incorporated CDSS accurate way
In stated process gathering clinical data medical knowledge putting form computers manipulate assist clinical decision support still infancy Nevertheless feasible business centrally even incompletely individual doctor try keep research published In addition laborious integration new data sometimes difficult quantify incorporate existing decision support schema particularly instances different clinical papers may appear conflicting
Properly resolving sorts discrepancies often subject clinical papers see meta analysis often take months complete
Evaluation In order CDSS offer value must demonstrably improve clinical workflow outcome
Evaluation CDSS process quantifying value improve system quality measure effectiveness
Because different CDSSs serve different purposes generic metric applies systems however attributes consistency experts often apply across wide spectrum systems The evaluation benchmark CDSS depends system goal example diagnostic decision support system may rated based upon consistency accuracy classification disease compared physicians decision support systems
An evidence based medicine system might rated based upon high incidence patient improvement higher financial reimbursement care providers
Combining electronic health records Implementing EHRs inevitable challenge
The reasons behind challenge relatively uncharted area many issues complications implementation phase EHR
This seen numerous studies undertaken
However challenges implementing electronic health records EHRs received attention less known process transitioning legacy EHRs newer systems EHRs way capture utilise real time data provide high quality patient care ensuring efficiency effective use time resources
Incorporating EHR CDSS together process medicine potential change way medicine taught practiced
It said highest level EHR CDSS Since clinical decision support systems CDSS computer systems designed impact clinician decision making individual patients point time decisions made clear would beneficial fully integrated CDSS EHR
Even though benefits seen fully implement CDSS integrated EHR historically required significant planning healthcare facility organisation order purpose CDSS successful effective
The success effectiveness measured increase patient care delivered reduced adverse events occurring
In addition would saving time resources benefits terms autonomy financial benefits healthcare facility organisation
Benefits CDSS combined EHR A successful CDSS EHR integration allow provision best practice high quality care patient ultimate goal healthcare
Errors always occurred healthcare trying minimise much possible important order provide quality patient care
Three areas addressed implementation CDSS Electronic Health Records EHRs Medication prescription errors Adverse drug events Other medical errorsCDSSs beneficial future healthcare facilities electronic terms real time patient information thus simplifying number modifications occur ensure systems date
The measurable benefits clinical decision support systems physician performance patient outcomes remain subject ongoing research
Barriers Implementing electronic health records EHR healthcare settings incurs challenges none important maintaining efficiency safety rollout order implementation process effective understanding EHR users perspectives key success EHR implementation projects
In addition adoption needs actively fostered bottom clinical needs first approach
The said CDSS
As main areas concern moving fully integrated EHR CDSS system Privacy Confidentiality User friendliness Document accuracy completeness Integration Uniformity Acceptance Alert desensitisationas well key aspects data entry need addressed implementing CDSS avoid potential adverse events occurring
These aspects include whether correct data used data entered system current best practice followed data evidence basedA service oriented architecture proposed technical means address barriers

OpenAI Five name machine learning project performs team video game bots playing human players competitive five five video game Dota
The system developed OpenAI American artificial intelligence AI research development company founded mission develop safe AI way benefits humanity
OpenAI Five first public appearance occurred demonstrated live one one game professional player game known Dendi lost
The following year system advanced point performing full team five began playing showing capability defeat professional teams
The company uses Dota experiment general purpose applied machine learning capture unpredictability continuous nature real world
The team stated complex nature game strong reliance work together team win major reason specifically chosen
The algorithms used project also applied systems controlling robotic hand
The project also compared number similar cases AI playing defeating humans Watson television game show Jeopardy Deep Blue chess AlphaGo board game Go
History Development algorithms used bots began November Dota competitive five five video game chosen due popular live streaming platform Twitch native support Linux application programming interface API available
Before becoming team five first public demonstration occurred The International August annual premiere championship tournament game Dendi professional Ukrainian player game lost OpenAI bot live one one matchup
After match CTO Greg Brockman explained bot learned playing two weeks real time learning software step direction creating software handle complex tasks like surgeon
OpenAI calls system reinforcement learning bots learn time playing hundreds times day months rewarded actions killing enemy destroying towers By June ability bots expanded play together full team five able defeat teams amateur semi professional players
At The International OpenAI Five played two games professional teams one Brazilian based paiN Gaming star team former Chinese players
Although bots lost matches OpenAI still considered successful venture stating playing best players Dota allowed analyze adjust algorithms future games
The bots final public demonstration occurred April best three series The International champions OG live event San Francisco
A four day online event play bots open public occurred month
There bots played total games winning
Architecture Each OpenAI Five network contains single layer unit LSTM observes current game state extracted Dota developer API
The neural network conducts actions via numerous possible action heads human data involved every head meaning
For instance number ticks delay action action select X Y coordinate action grid around unit
In addition action heads computed independently
The AI system observes world list numbers takes action conducting list eight enumeration values
Also selects different actions targets understand encode every action observe world OpenAI Five developed general purpose reinforcement learning training system Rapid infrastructure
Rapid consists two layers spins thousands machines helps talk second layer runs software

Autonomic computing AC refers self managing characteristics distributed computing resources adapting unpredictable changes hiding intrinsic complexity operators users
Initiated IBM initiative ultimately aimed develop computer systems capable self management overcome rapidly growing complexity computing systems management reduce barrier complexity poses growth
Description The AC system concept designed make adaptive decisions using high level policies
It constantly check optimize status automatically adapt changing conditions
An autonomic computing framework composed autonomic components AC interacting
An AC modeled terms two main control schemes local global sensors self monitoring effectors self adjustment knowledge planner adapter exploiting policies based self environment awareness
This architecture sometimes referred Monitor Analyze Plan Execute MAPE
Driven vision variety architectural frameworks based self regulating autonomic components recently proposed
A similar trend recently characterized significant research area multi agent systems
However approaches typically conceived centralized cluster based server architectures mind mostly address need reducing management costs rather need enabling complex software systems providing innovative services
Some autonomic systems involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms Autonomy oriented computation paradigm proposed Jiming Liu uses artificial systems imitating social animals collective behaviours solve difficult computational problems
For example ant colony optimization could studied paradigm
Problem growing complexity Forecasts suggest computing devices use grow per year average complexity device increasing
Currently volume complexity managed highly skilled humans demand skilled IT personnel already outstripping supply labour costs exceeding equipment costs ratio
Computing systems brought great benefits speed automation overwhelming economic need automate maintenance
In IEEE Computer article Kephart Chess warn dream interconnectivity computing systems devices could become nightmare pervasive computing architects unable anticipate design maintain complexity interactions

Most autonomic service providers guarantee basic plumbing layer power hardware operating system network basic database parameters
Characteristics autonomic systems A possible solution could enable modern networked computing systems manage without direct human intervention
The Autonomic Computing Initiative ACI aims providing foundation autonomic systems
It inspired autonomic nervous system human body
This nervous system controls important bodily functions e g

IBM set forth eight conditions define autonomic system The system must know terms resources access capabilities limitations connected systems able automatically configure reconfigure depending changing computing environment able optimize performance ensure efficient computing process able work around encountered problems either repairing routing functions away trouble detect identify protect various types attacks maintain overall system security integrity adapt environment changes interacting neighboring systems establishing communication protocols rely open standards cannot exist proprietary environment anticipate demand resources staying transparent users Even though purpose thus behaviour autonomic systems vary system system every autonomic system able exhibit minimum set properties achieve purpose Automatic This essentially means able self control internal functions operations
As autonomic system must self contained able start operate without manual intervention external help
Again knowledge required bootstrap system Know must inherent system
Adaptive An autonomic system must able change operation e configuration state functions
This allow system cope temporal spatial changes operational context either long term environment customisation optimisation short term exceptional conditions malicious attacks faults etc
Aware An autonomic system must able monitor sense operational context well internal state order able assess current operation serves purpose
Awareness control adaptation operational behaviour response context state changes
Evolutionary levels IBM defined five evolutionary levels autonomic deployment model deployment autonomic systems Level basic level presents current situation systems essentially managed manually
Levels introduce increasingly automated management functions level represents ultimate goal autonomic self managing systems
Design patterns The design complexity Autonomic Systems simplified utilizing design patterns model view controller MVC pattern improve concern separation encapsulating functional concerns
Control loops A basic concept applied Autonomic Systems closed control loops
This well known concept stems Process Control Theory
Essentially closed control loop self managing system monitors resource software hardware component autonomously tries keep parameters within desired range
According IBM hundreds even thousands control loops expected work large scale self managing computer system

D reconstruction multiple images creation three dimensional models set images
It reverse process obtaining D images D scenes
The essence image projection D scene onto D plane process depth lost
The D point corresponding specific image point constrained line sight
From single image impossible determine point line corresponds image point
If two images available position D point found intersection two projection rays
This process referred triangulation
The key process relations multiple views convey information corresponding sets points must contain structure structure related poses calibration camera
In recent decades important demand D content computer graphics virtual reality communication triggering change emphasis requirements
Many existing systems constructing D models built around specialized hardware e g
stereo rigs resulting high cost cannot satisfy requirement new applications
This gap stimulates use digital imaging facilities like camera
An early method proposed Tomasi Kanade
They used affine factorization approach extract D images sequences
However assumption orthographic projection significant limitation system
Processing The task converting multiple D images D model consists series processing steps Camera calibration consists intrinsic extrinsic parameters without level arrangement algorithms work
The dotted line Calibration Depth determination represents camera calibration usually required determining depth
Depth determination serves challenging part whole process calculates D component missing given image depth
The correspondence problem finding matches two images position matched elements triangulated D space key issue
Once multiple depth maps combine create final mesh calculating depth projecting camera registration
Camera calibration used identify many meshes created depth maps combined together develop larger one providing one view observation
By stage Material Application complete D mesh may final goal usually want apply color original photographs mesh
This range projecting images onto mesh randomly approaches combining textures super resolution finally segmenting mesh material specular diffuse properties

If P displaystyle P w j displaystyle w_ j satisfy P T displaystyle P T T w j displaystyle T w_ j satisfy nonsingular matrix T A projective reconstruction calculated correspondence points without priori information
Autocalibration Autocalibration self calibration classical approach camera motion parameters recovered first using rigidity structure readily calculated
Two methods implementing idea presented follows Kruppa equations With minimum three displacements obtain internal parameters camera using system polynomial equations due Kruppa derived geometric interpretation rigidity constraint The matrix K A A displaystyle K AA top unknown Kruppa equations named Kruppa coefficients matrix

Stratification Recently new methods based concept stratification proposed
Starting projective structure calculated correspondences upgrade projective reconstruction Euclidean reconstruction making use available constraints
With idea problem stratified different sections according amount constraints available analyzed different level projective affine Euclidean
The stratification D geometry Usually world perceived D Euclidean space
In cases possible use full Euclidean structure D space
The simplest projective affine geometry forms intermediate layers finally Euclidean geometry
The concept stratification closely related series transformations geometric entities projective stratum series projective transformations homography affine stratum series affine transformations Euclidean stratum series Euclidean transformations
Suppose fixed scene captured two perspective cameras correspondences visible points different images already given
However practice matching essential extremely challenging issue computer vision
Here suppose n displaystyle n D points A displaystyle A_ observed displaystyle cameras projection matrices P j j
displaystyle P_ j j ldots Neither positions point projection camera known
Only projections j displaystyle a_ ij h displaystyle th point j h displaystyle j th image known
Projective reconstruction Simple counting indicates n displaystyle nm independent measurements n displaystyle n unknowns problem supposed soluble enough points images
The equations homogeneous coordinates represented j P j A n j displaystyle a_ ij sim P_ j A_ qquad ldots n j ldots So apply nonsingular transformation H projections P j displaystyle P_ j P j H displaystyle P_ j H world points A displaystyle A_ H A displaystyle HA_
Hence without constraints reconstruction unknown projective deformation D world
Affine reconstruction See affine space detailed information computing location plane infinity Π displaystyle Pi _ infty
The simplest way exploit prior knowledge example information lines scene parallel point one thirds two others
We also use prior constraints camera motion
By analyzing different images point obtain line direction motion
The intersection several lines point infinity motion direction one constraint affine structure
Euclidean reconstruction By mapping projective reconstruction one satisfies group redundant Euclidean constraints find projective transformation H equation The equations highly nonlinear good initial guess structure required
This obtained assuming linear projection parallel projection also allows easy reconstruction SVD decomposition
Algebraic vs geometric error Inevitably measured data e image world point positions noisy noise comes many sources
To reduce effect noise usually use equations necessary solve least squares
For example typical null space problem formulation Ax like DLT algorithm square residual Ax minimized least squares method
In general Ax considered distance geometrical entities points lines planes etc
minimized geometric error otherwise error lacks good geometrical interpretation called algebraic error
Therefore compared algebraic error prefer minimize geometric error reasons listed The quantity minimized meaning
The solution stable
The solution constant Euclidean transforms All linear algorithms DLT others seen far minimize algebraic error
Actually justification minimizing algebraic error apart ease implementation results linear problem
The minimization geometric error often non linear problem admit iterative solutions requires starting point
Usually linear solution based algebraic residuals serves starting point non linear minimization geometric cost function provides solution final polish
D reconstruction Medical Images Motivation applications The D imaging problems anatomy overlapping disclose abnormalities
The D imaging used diagnostic therapeutic purposes
D models used planning operation morphometric studies reliability orthopedics
Problem statement Basics To reconstruct D images D images taken camera multiple angles
Medical imaging techniques like CT scanning MRI expensive although CT scans accurate induce high radiation doses risk patients certain diseases
Methods based MRI accurate
Since exposed powerful magnetic fields MRI scan method suitable patients ferromagnetic metallic implants
Both methods done lying position global structure bone changes
So discuss following methods performed standing require low radiation dose
Though techniques D imaging region interest restricted slice data acquired form time sequence
Stereo Corresponding Point Based Technique This method simple implemented identifying points manually multi view radiographs
The first step extract corresponding points two x ray images second step D reconstruction algorithms like Discrete Linear Transform
Using DLT reconstruction done SCPs
By increasing number points results improve time consuming
This method low accuracy low reproducibility time consumption
This method dependent skill operator
This method suitable bony structures continuous shape
This method generally used initial solution methods
Non Stereo corresponding contour method NCSS This method uses X ray images D Reconstruction develop D models low dose radiations weight bearing positions
In NSCC algorithm preliminary step calculation initial solution
Firstly anatomical regions generic object defined
Secondly manual D contours identification radiographs performed
From radiograph D contours generated using D initial solution object
D contours initial object surface projected onto associated radiograph
The D association performed set points based point point distances contours derivations developing correspondence D contours D contours
Next step optimization initial solution
Lastly deformation optimized solution done applying Kriging algorithm optimized solution
Finally iterating final step distance two set points superior given precision value reconstructed object obtained
The advantage method used bony structures continuous shape also reduced human intervention time consuming
Surface Rendering technique Surface Rendering technique visualizes D object set surfaces called iso surfaces
Each surface points intensity called iso value
It used want see separated structures e g
skull slices head blood vessel system slices body etc
This technique used mostly high contrast data
Two main methods reconstructing Contour based reconstruction Iso contours attached form iso surfaces Voxel based reconstruction Voxels intensity values used form iso surfaces

The principle rationality rationality principle coined Karl R Popper Harvard Lecture published book Myth Framework
It related called logic situation Economica article published later book The Poverty Historicism
According Popper rationality principle agents act adequate way according objective situation
It idealized conception human behavior used drive model situational analysis
Popper Popper called social science grounded called situational analysis
This requires building models social situations include individual actors relationship social institutions e g
markets legal codes bureaucracies etc
These models attribute certain aims information actors
This forms logic situation result reconstructing meticulously circumstances historical event
The principle rationality assumption people instrumental trying reach goals drives model
Popper believed model could continuously refined approach objective truth
Popper called principle rationality nearly empty technical term meaning without empirical content strictly speaking false nonetheless tremendously useful
These remarks earned lot criticism seemingly swerved famous Logic Scientific Discovery
Among many philosophers discussed principle rationality Noretta Koertge R Nadeau Viktor J Vanberg Hans Albert E Matzner Ian C Jarvie Mark A Notturno John Wettersten Ian C Böhm
Newell In context knowledge based systems Newell proposed following principle rationality If agent knowledge one actions lead one goals agent select action
This principle employed agents knowledge level move closer desired goal
An important philosophical difference Newell Popper Newell argued knowledge level real sense exists nature made
This allowed Newell treat rationality principle way understanding nature avoid problems Popper ran treating knowledge non physical therefore non empirical

Description logics DL family formal knowledge representation languages
Many DLs expressive propositional logic less expressive first order logic
In contrast latter core reasoning problems DLs usually decidable efficient decision procedures designed implemented problems
There general spatial temporal spatiotemporal fuzzy descriptions logics description logic features different balance expressive power reasoning complexity supporting different sets mathematical constructors DLs used artificial intelligence describe reason relevant concepts application domain known terminological knowledge
It particular importance providing logical formalism ontologies Semantic Web Web Ontology Language OWL profile based DLs
The notable application DLs OWL biomedical informatics DL assists codification biomedical knowledge
Introduction A description logic DL models concepts roles individuals relationships
The fundamental modeling concept DL axiom logical statement relating roles concepts
This key difference frames paradigm frame specification declares completely defines class

History Description logic given current name

Knowledge representation Frames semantic networks lack formal logic based semantics
DL first introduced knowledge representation KR systems overcome deficiency The first DL based KR system KL ONE Ronald J Brachman Schmolze
During DL based systems using structural subsumption algorithms developed including KRYPTON LOOM BACK K REP CLASSIC
This approach featured DL limited expressiveness relatively efficient polynomial time reasoning In early introduction new tableau based algorithm paradigm allowed efficient reasoning expressive DL
DL based systems using algorithms KRIS show acceptable reasoning performance typical inference problems even though worst case complexity longer polynomial From mid reasoners created good practical performance expressive DL high worst case complexity

In completed issuance OWL recommendation
OWL based description logic S R O I Q D displaystyle mathcal SROIQ mathcal D
Practical experience demonstrated OWL DL lacked several key features necessary model complex domains
Modeling In DL distinction drawn called TBox terminological box ABox assertional box
In general TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies e relations concepts ABox contains ground sentences stating hierarchy individuals belong e relations individuals concepts
For example statement belongs TBox statement belongs ABox
Note TBox ABox distinction significant sense two kinds sentences treated differently first order logic subsumes DL
When translated first order logic subsumption axiom like simply conditional restriction unary predicates concepts variables appearing
Clearly sentence form privileged special sentences constants grounded values appear like
So distinction introduced
The primary reason separation useful describing formulating decision procedures various DL
For example reasoner might process TBox ABox separately part certain key inference problems tied one one classification related TBox instance checking ABox
Another example complexity TBox greatly affect performance given decision procedure certain DL independently ABox
Thus useful way talk specific part knowledge base
The secondary reason distinction make sense knowledge base modeler perspective
It plausible distinguish conception terms concepts world class axioms TBox particular manifestations terms concepts instance assertions ABox
In example hierarchy within company every branch assignment employees different every department people working makes sense reuse TBox different branches use ABox
There two features description logic shared data description formalisms DL make unique name assumption UNA closed world assumption CWA
Not UNA means two concepts different names may allowed inference shown equivalent
Not CWA rather open world assumption OWA means lack knowledge fact immediately imply knowledge negation fact
Formal description Like first order logic FOL syntax defines collections symbols legal expressions description logic semantics determine meaning
Unlike FOL DL may several well known syntactic variants
Syntax The syntax member description logic family characterized recursive definition constructors used form concept terms stated
Some constructors related logical constructors first order logic FOL intersection conjunction concepts union disjunction concepts negation complement concepts universal restriction existential restriction
Other constructors corresponding construction FOL including restrictions roles example inverse transitivity functionality
Notation Let C D concepts b individuals R role
If R related b b called R successor

The common decision problems basic database query like questions like instance checking particular instance member A box member given concept relation checking relation role hold two instances words property b global database questions like subsumption concept subset another concept concept consistency contradiction among definitions chain definitions
The operators one includes logic complicated T box cycles allowing non atomic concepts include usually higher computational complexity problems see Description Logic Complexity Navigator examples
Relationship logics First order logic Many DLs decidable fragments first order logic FOL usually fragments two variable logic guarded logic
In addition DLs features covered FOL includes concrete domains integer strings used ranges roles hasAge hasName operator roles transitive closure role
Fuzzy description logic Fuzzy description logics combines fuzzy logic DLs
Since many concepts needed intelligent systems lack well defined boundaries precisely defined criteria membership fuzzy logic needed deal notions vagueness imprecision
This offers motivation generalization description logic towards dealing imprecise vague concepts
Modal logic Description logic related developed independently modal logic ML
Many DLs syntactic variants ML In general object corresponds possible world concept corresponds modal proposition role bounded quantifier modal operator role accessibility relation
Operations roles composition inversion etc
correspond modal operations used dynamic logic
Examples Temporal description logic Temporal description logic represents allows reasoning time dependent concepts many different approaches problem exist
For example description logic might combined modal temporal logic linear temporal logic

Affective computing study development systems devices recognize interpret process simulate human affects
It interdisciplinary field spanning computer science psychology cognitive science
While core ideas field may traced far back early philosophical inquiries emotion modern branch computer science originated Rosalind Picard paper affective computing book Affective Computing published MIT Press
One motivations research ability give machines emotional intelligence including simulate empathy
The machine interpret emotional state humans adapt behavior giving appropriate response emotions
Areas Detecting recognizing emotional information Detecting emotional information usually begins passive sensors capture data user physical state behavior without interpreting input
The data gathered analogous cues humans use perceive emotions others
For example video camera might capture facial expressions body posture gestures microphone might capture speech
Other sensors detect emotional cues directly measuring physiological data skin temperature galvanic resistance Recognizing emotional information requires extraction meaningful patterns gathered data
This done using machine learning techniques process different modalities speech recognition natural language processing facial expression detection
The goal techniques produce labels would match labels human perceiver would give situation For example person makes facial expression furrowing brow computer vision system might taught label face appearing confused concentrating slightly negative opposed positive might say smiling happy appearing way
These labels may may correspond person actually feeling
Emotion machines Another area within affective computing design computational devices proposed exhibit either innate emotional capabilities capable convincingly simulating emotions
A practical approach based current technological capabilities simulation emotions conversational agents order enrich facilitate interactivity human machine Marvin Minsky one pioneering computer scientists artificial intelligence relates emotions broader issues machine intelligence stating The Emotion Machine emotion especially different processes call thinking
Technologies In psychology cognitive science neuroscience two main approaches describing humans perceive classify emotion continuous categorical
The continuous approach tends use dimensions negative vs positive calm vs aroused
The categorical approach tends use discrete classes happy sad angry fearful surprise disgust
Different kinds machine learning regression classification models used machines produce continuous discrete labels
Sometimes models also built allow combinations across categories e g
happy surprised face fearful surprised face
The following sections consider many kinds input data used task emotion recognition
Emotional speech Various changes autonomic nervous system indirectly alter person speech affective technologies leverage information recognize emotion
For example speech produced state fear anger joy becomes fast loud precisely enunciated higher wider range pitch whereas emotions tiredness boredom sadness tend generate slow low pitched slurred speech
Some emotions found easily computationally identified anger approval Emotional speech processing technologies recognize user emotional state using computational analysis speech features
Vocal parameters prosodic features pitch variables speech rate analyzed pattern recognition techniques Speech analysis effective method identifying affective state average reported accuracy recent research
These systems tend outperform average human accuracy approximately less accurate systems employ modalities emotion detection physiological states facial expressions
However since many speech characteristics independent semantics culture technique considered promising route research
Algorithms The process speech text affect detection requires creation reliable database knowledge base vector space model broad enough fit every need application well selection successful classifier allow quick accurate emotion identification
Currently frequently used classifiers linear discriminant classifiers LDC k nearest neighbor k NN Gaussian mixture model GMM support vector machines SVM artificial neural networks ANN decision tree algorithms hidden Markov models HMMs
Various studies showed choosing appropriate classifier significantly enhance overall performance system
The list gives brief description algorithm LDC Classification happens based value obtained linear combination feature values usually provided form vector features
k NN Classification happens locating object feature space comparing k nearest neighbors training examples
The majority vote decides classification
GMM probabilistic model used representing existence subpopulations within overall population
Each sub population described using mixture distribution allows classification observations sub populations
SVM type usually binary linear classifier decides two possible classes input may fall
ANN mathematical model inspired biological neural networks better grasp possible non linearities feature space
Decision tree algorithms work based following decision tree leaves represent classification outcome branches represent conjunction subsequent features lead classification
HMMs statistical Markov model states state transitions directly available observation
Instead series outputs dependent states visible
In case affect recognition outputs represent sequence speech feature vectors allow deduction states sequences model progressed
The states consist various intermediate steps expression emotion probability distribution possible output vectors
The states sequences allow us predict affective state trying classify one commonly used techniques within area speech affect detection It proved enough acoustic evidence available emotional state person classified set majority voting classifiers
The proposed set classifiers based three main classifiers kNN C SVM RBF Kernel
This set achieves better performance basic classifier taken separately
It compared two sets classifiers one OAA multiclass SVM Hybrid kernels set classifiers consists following two basic classifiers C Neural Network
The proposed variant achieves better performance two sets classifiers
Databases The vast majority present systems data dependent
This creates one biggest challenges detecting emotions based speech implicates choosing appropriate database used train classifier
Most currently possessed data obtained actors thus representation archetypal emotions
Those called acted databases usually based Basic Emotions theory Paul Ekman assumes existence six basic emotions anger fear disgust surprise joy sadness others simply mix former ones
Nevertheless still offer high audio quality balanced classes although often contribute high success rates recognizing emotions
However real life application naturalistic data preferred
A naturalistic database produced observation analysis subjects natural context
Ultimately database allow system recognize emotions based context well work goals outcomes interaction
The nature type data allows authentic real life implementation due fact describes states naturally occurring human computer interaction HCI
Despite numerous advantages naturalistic data acted data difficult obtain usually low emotional intensity
Moreover data obtained natural context lower signal quality due surroundings noise distance subjects microphone
The first attempt produce database FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus CEICES Combining Efforts Improving Automatic Classification Emotional User States developed based realistic context children age playing Sony Aibo robot pet
Likewise producing one standard database emotional research would provide method evaluating comparing different affect recognition systems
Speech descriptors The complexity affect recognition process increases number classes affects speech descriptors used within classifier
It therefore crucial select relevant features order assure ability model successfully identify emotions well increasing performance particularly significant real time detection
The range possible choices vast studies mentioning use distinct features
It crucial identify redundant undesirable order optimize system increase success rate correct emotion detection
The common speech characteristics categorized following groups
Frequency characteristics Accent shape affected rate change fundamental frequency
Average pitch description high low speaker speaks relative normal speech
Contour slope describes tendency frequency change time rising falling level
Final lowering amount frequency falls end utterance
Pitch range measures spread maximum minimum frequency utterance
Time related features Speech rate describes rate words syllables uttered unit time Stress frequency measures rate occurrences pitch accented utterances Voice quality parameters energy descriptors Breathiness measures aspiration noise speech Brilliance describes dominance high Or low frequencies In speech Loudness measures amplitude speech waveform translates energy utterance Pause Discontinuity describes transitions sound silence Pitch Discontinuity describes transitions fundamental frequency
Facial affect detection The detection processing facial expression achieved various methods optical flow hidden Markov models neural network processing active appearance models
More one modalities combined fused multimodal recognition e g
facial expressions speech prosody facial expressions hand gestures facial expressions speech text multimodal data metadata analysis provide robust estimation subject emotional state
Facial expression databases Creation emotion database difficult time consuming task
However database creation essential step creation system recognize human emotions
Most publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions
In posed expression databases participants asked display different basic emotional expressions spontaneous expression database expressions natural
Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort selection proper stimuli lead rich display intended emotions
Secondly process involves tagging emotions trained individuals manually makes databases highly reliable
Since perception expressions intensity subjective nature annotation experts essential purpose validation
Researchers work three types databases database peak expression images database image sequences portraying emotion neutral peak video clips emotional annotations
Many facial expression databases created made public expression recognition purpose
Two widely used databases CK JAFFE
Emotion classification By cross cultural research Papua New Guinea Fore Tribesmen end Paul Ekman proposed idea facial expressions emotion culturally determined universal
Thus suggested biological origin therefore safely correctly categorized
He therefore officially put forth six basic emotions Anger Disgust Fear Happiness Sadness SurpriseHowever Ekman expanded list basic emotions including range positive negative emotions encoded facial muscles
The newly included emotions Amusement Contempt Contentment Embarrassment Excitement Guilt Pride achievement Relief Satisfaction Sensory pleasure Shame Facial Action Coding System A system conceived psychologists order formally categorize physical expression emotions faces
The central concept Facial Action Coding System FACS created Paul Ekman Wallace V Friesen based earlier work Carl Herman Hjortsjö action units AU
They basically contraction relaxation one muscles
Psychologists proposed following classification six basic emotions according action units mean Challenges facial detection As every computational practice affect detection facial processing obstacles need surpassed order fully unlock hidden potential overall algorithm method employed
In early days almost every kind AI based detection speech recognition face recognition affect recognition accuracy modeling tracking issue
As hardware evolves data collected new discoveries made new practices introduced lack accuracy fades leaving behind noise issues
However methods noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging linear Gaussian smoothing median filtering newer methods Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm Other challenges include The fact posed expressions used subjects various studies natural therefore algorithms trained may apply natural expressions
The lack rotational movement freedom
Affect detection works well frontal use upon rotating head degrees problems
Facial expressions always correspond underlying emotion matches e g
posed faked person feel emotions maintain poker face
FACS include dynamics dynamics help disambiguate e g
smiles genuine happiness tend different dynamics try look happy smiles
The FACS combinations correspond way emotions psychologists originally proposed note lack mapping also occurs speech recognition homophones homonyms many sources ambiguity may mitigated bringing channels information
Accuracy recognition improved adding context however adding context modalities increases computational cost complexity Body gesture Gestures could efficiently used means detecting particular emotional state user especially used conjunction speech face recognition
Depending specific action gestures could simple reflexive responses like lifting shoulders know answer question could complex meaningful communicating sign language
Without making use object surrounding environment wave hands clap beckon
On hand using objects point move touch handle
A computer able recognize analyze context respond meaningful way order efficiently used Human Computer Interaction
There many proposed methods detect body gesture
Some literature differentiates different approaches gesture recognition D model based appearance based
The foremost method makes use D information key elements body parts order obtain several important parameters like palm position joint angles
On hand appearance based systems use images videos direct interpretation
Hand gestures common focus body gesture detection methods
Physiological monitoring This could used detect user affective state monitoring analyzing physiological signs
These signs range changes heart rate skin conductance minute contractions facial muscles changes facial blood flow
This area gaining momentum seeing real products implement techniques
The four main physiological signs usually analyzed blood volume pulse galvanic skin response facial electromyography facial color patterns
Blood volume pulse Overview A subject blood volume pulse BVP measured process called photoplethysmography produces graph indicating blood flow extremities
The peaks waves indicate cardiac cycle heart pumped blood extremities
If subject experiences fear startled heart usually jumps beats quickly time causing amplitude cardiac cycle increase
This clearly seen photoplethysmograph distance trough peak wave decreased
As subject calms body inner core expands allowing blood flow back extremities cycle return normal
Methodology Infra red light shone skin special sensor hardware amount light reflected measured
The amount reflected transmitted light correlates BVP light absorbed hemoglobin found richly blood stream
Disadvantages It cumbersome ensure sensor shining infra red light monitoring reflected light always pointing extremity especially seeing subjects often stretch readjust position using computer
There factors affect one blood volume pulse
As measure blood flow extremities subject feels hot particularly cold body may allow less blood flow extremities regardless subject emotional state
Facial electromyography Facial electromyography technique used measure electrical activity facial muscles amplifying tiny electrical impulses generated muscle fibers contract
The face expresses great deal emotion however two main facial muscle groups usually studied detect emotion The corrugator supercilii muscle also known frowning muscle draws brow frown therefore best test negative unpleasant emotional response The zygomaticus major muscle responsible pulling corners mouth back smile therefore muscle used test positive emotional response
Galvanic skin response Galvanic skin response GSR outdated term general phenomenon known Electrodermal Activity EDA
EDA general phenomena whereby skin electrical properties change
The skin innervated sympathetic nervous system measuring resistance conductance provides way quantify small changes sympathetic branch autonomic nervous system
As sweat glands activated even skin feels sweaty level EDA captured usually using conductance used discern small changes autonomic arousal
The aroused subject greater skin conductance tends Skin conductance often measured using two small silver silver chloride electrodes placed somewhere skin applying small voltage
To maximize comfort reduce irritation electrodes placed wrist legs feet leaves hands fully free daily activity
Facial color Overview The surface human face innervated large network blood vessels
Blood flow variations vessels yield visible color changes face
Whether facial emotions activate facial muscles variations blood flow blood pressure glucose levels changes occur
Also facial color signal independent provided facial muscle movements
Methodology Approaches based facial color changes
Delaunay triangulation used create triangular local areas
Some triangles define interior mouth eyes sclera iris removed
Use left triangular areas pixels create feature vectors
It shows converting pixel color standard RGB color space color space oRGB color space LMS channels perform better dealing faces
So map vector onto better color space decompose red green yellow blue channels
Then use deep learning methods find equivalent emotions
Visual aesthetics Aesthetics world art photography refers principles nature appreciation beauty
Judging beauty aesthetic qualities highly subjective task
Computer scientists Penn State treat challenge automatically inferring aesthetic quality pictures using visual content machine learning problem peer rated line photo sharing website data source
They extract certain visual features based intuition discriminate aesthetically pleasing displeasing images
Potential applications Education Affection influences learners learning state
Using affective computing technology computers judge learners affection learning state recognizing facial expressions
In education teacher use analysis result understand student learning accepting ability formulate reasonable teaching plans
At time pay attention students inner feelings helpful students phycological health
Especially distance education due separation time space emotional incentive teachers students two way communication
Without atmosphere brought traditional classroom learning students easily bored affect learning effect
Applying affective computing distance education system effectively improve situation
Healthcare Social robots well growing number robots used health care benefit emotional awareness better judge users patient emotional states alter actions programming appropriately
This especially important countries growing aging populations lack younger workers address needs Affective computing also applied development communicative technologies use people autism
The affective component text also increasingly gaining attention particularly role called emotional emotive Internet
Video games Affective video games access players emotional states biofeedback devices
A particularly simple form biofeedback available gamepads measure pressure button pressed shown correlate strongly players level arousal end scale brain computer interfaces
Affective games used medical research support emotional development autistic children
Other applications Other potential applications centered around social monitoring
For example car monitor emotion occupants engage additional safety measures alerting vehicles detects driver angry
Affective computing potential applications human computer interaction affective mirrors allowing user see performs emotion monitoring agents sending warning one sends angry email even music players selecting tracks based mood One idea put forth Romanian researcher Dr Nicu Sebe interview analysis person face using certain product mentioned ice cream example
Companies would able use analysis infer whether product well received respective market
One could also use affective state recognition order judge impact TV advertisement real time video recording person subsequent study facial expression
Averaging results obtained large group subjects one tell whether commercial movie desired effect elements interest watcher
Cognitivist vs interactional approaches Within field human computer interaction Rosalind Picard cognitivist information model concept emotion criticized contrasted post cognitivist interactional pragmatist approach taken Kirsten Boehner others views emotion inherently social Picard focus human computer interaction goal affective computing give computers ability recognize express cases emotions
In contrast interactional approach seeks help people understand experience emotions improve computer mediated interpersonal communication
It necessarily seek map emotion objective mathematical model machine interpretation rather let humans make sense emotional expressions open ended ways might ambiguous subjective sensitive context Picard critics describe concept emotion objective internal private mechanistic
They say reduces emotion discrete psychological signal occurring inside body measured input cognition undercutting complexity emotional experience The interactional approach asserts though emotion biophysical aspects culturally grounded dynamically experienced degree constructed action interaction
Put another way considers emotion social cultural product experienced interactions

In economics game theory decision theory artificial intelligence rational agent agent clear preferences models uncertainty via expected values variables functions variables always chooses perform action optimal expected outcome among feasible actions
A rational agent anything makes decisions typically person firm machine software
Rational agents also studied fields cognitive science ethics philosophy including philosophy practical reason
Economics In reference economics rational agent refers hypothetical consumers make decisions free market
This concept one assumptions made neoclassical economic theory
The concept economic rationality arises tradition marginal analysis used neoclassical economics
The idea rational agent important philosophy utilitarianism detailed philosopher Jeremy Bentham theory felicific calculus also known hedonistic calculus
The action rational agent takes depends preferences agent agent information environment may come past experiences actions duties obligations available agent estimated actual benefits chances success actions In game theory classical economics often assumed actors people firms rational
However extent people firms behave rationally subject debate
Economists often assume models rational choice theory bounded rationality formalize predict behavior individuals firms
Rational agents sometimes behave manners counter intuitive many people traveler dilemma
Criticisms Many economic theories reject utilitarianism rational agency especially might considered heterodox
For example Thorstein Veblen known father institutional economics rejects notion hedonistic calculus pure rationality saying The hedonistic conception man lightning calculator pleasures pains oscillates like homogeneous globule desire happiness impulse stimuli shift area leave intact
Veblen instead perceives human economic decisions result multiple complex cumulative factors It characteristic man something simply suffer pleasures pains impact suitable forces
He coherent structure propensities habits seeks realization expression unfolding activity

They products hereditary traits past experience cumulatively wrought given body traditions conventionalities material circumstances afford point departure next step process
The economic life history individual cumulative process adaptation means ends cumulatively change process goes agent environment point outcome last process
Evolutionary economics also provides criticisms Rational Agent citing parental bent idea biological impulses frequently override rational decision making based utility
Arguments rational agency also cited enormous influence marketing proof humans persuaded make economic decisions non rational nature
Alternate theories Neuroeconomics concept uses neuroscience social psychology fields science better understand people make decisions
Unlike rational agent theory neuroeconomics attempt predict large scale human behavior rather individuals make decisions case case scenarios
Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence borrowed term rational agents economics describe autonomous programs capable goal directed behavior
Today considerable overlap AI research game theory decision theory

Catastrophic interference also known catastrophic forgetting tendency artificial neural network completely abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning new information
Neural networks important part network approach connectionist approach cognitive science
These networks use computer simulations try model human behaviours memory learning
Catastrophic interference important issue consider creating connectionist models memory
It originally brought attention scientific community research McCloskey Cohen Ratcliff
It radical manifestation sensitivity stability dilemma stability plasticity dilemma
Specifically problems refer issue able make artificial neural network sensitive disrupted new information
Lookup tables connectionist networks lie opposite sides stability plasticity spectrum
The former remains completely stable presence new information lacks ability generalize e
infer general principles new inputs
On hand connectionist networks like standard backpropagation network sensitive new information generalize new inputs
Backpropagation models considered good models human memory insofar mirror human ability generalize networks often exhibit less stability human memory
Notably backpropagation networks susceptible catastrophic interference
This considered issue attempting model human memory unlike networks humans typically show catastrophic forgetting
Thus issue catastrophic interference must eradicated backpropagation models order enhance plausibility models human memory
History catastrophic interference The term catastrophic interference originally coined McCloskey Cohen also brought attention scientific community research Ratcliff
The Sequential Learning Problem McCloskey Cohen McCloskey Cohen noted problem catastrophic interference two different experiments backpropagation neural network modelling
Experiment Learning ones twos addition factsIn first experiment trained standard backpropagation neural network single training set consisting single digit ones problems e network could represent respond properly
The error actual output desired output steadily declined across training sessions reflected network learned represent target outputs better across trials
Next trained network single training set consisting single digit twos problems e network could represent respond properly
They noted procedure similar child would learn addition facts
Following learning trial twos facts network tested knowledge ones twos addition facts
Like ones facts twos facts readily learned network
However McCloskey Cohen noted network longer able properly answer ones addition problems even one learning trial twos addition problems
The output pattern produced response ones facts often resembled output pattern incorrect number closely output pattern correct number
This considered drastic amount error
Furthermore problems included training sets even showed dramatic disruption first learning trials twos facts
Experiment Replication Barnes Underwood studyIn second connectionist model McCloskey Cohen attempted replicate study retroactive interference humans Barnes Underwood
They trained model A B A C lists used context pattern input vector input pattern differentiate lists
Specifically network trained responds right B response shown A stimulus A B context pattern respond correct C response shown A stimulus A C context pattern
When model trained concurrently A B A C items network readily learned associations correctly
In sequential training A B list trained first followed A C list
After presentation A C list performance measured A B A C lists
They found amount training A C list Barnes Underwood study lead correct responses lead nearly correct responses backpropagation network
Furthermore found network tended show responses looked like C response pattern network prompted give B response pattern
This indicated A C list apparently overwritten A B list
This could likened learning word dog followed learning word stool finding cannot recognize word cat well instead think word stool presented word dog
McCloskey Cohen tried reduce interference number manipulations including changing number hidden units changing value learning rate parameter overtraining A B list freezing certain connection weights changing target values instead
However none manipulations satisfactorily reduced catastrophic interference exhibited networks
Overall McCloskey Cohen concluded least interference occur whenever new learning alters weights involved representing greater amount new learning greater disruption old knowledge interference catastrophic backpropagation networks learning sequential concurrent Constraints Imposed Learning Forgetting Functions Ratcliff Ratcliff used multiple sets backpropagation models applied standard recognition memory procedures items sequentially learned
After inspecting recognition performance models found two major problems Well learned information catastrophically forgotten new information learned small large backpropagation networks Even one learning trial new information resulted significant loss old information paralleling findings McCloskey Cohen
Ratcliff also found resulting outputs often blend previous input new input
In larger networks items learned groups e g
AB CD resistant forgetting items learned singly e g
A B C
However forgetting items learned groups still large
Adding new hidden units network reduce interference
Discrimination studied items previously unseen items decreased network learned This finding contradicts studies human memory indicated discrimination increases learning
Ratcliff attempted alleviate problem adding response nodes would selectively respond old new inputs
However method work response nodes would become active inputs
A model used context pattern also failed increase discrimination new old items
Proposed solutions Many researchers suggested main cause catastrophic interference overlap representations hidden layer distributed neural networks
In distributed representation given input tend create changes weights many nodes
Catastrophic forgetting occurs many weights knowledge stored changed impossible prior knowledge kept intact
During sequential learning inputs become mixed new input superimposed top old input
Another way conceptualize visualizing learning movement weight space
This weight space likened spatial representation possible combinations weights network possess
When network first learns represent set patterns found point weight space allows recognize patterns seen
However network learns new set patterns sequentially move place weight space allows recognize new pattern
To recognize sets patterns network must find place weight space represent new old output
One way connecting hidden unit subset input units
This reduces likelihood two different inputs encoded hidden units weights decrease chance interference
Indeed number proposed solutions catastrophic interference involve reducing amount overlap occurs storing information weights
Many early techniques reducing representational overlap involved making either input vectors hidden unit activation patterns orthogonal one another
Lewandowsky Li noted interference sequentially learned patterns minimized input vectors orthogonal
Input vectors said orthogonal pairwise product elements across two vectors sum zero
For example patterns said orthogonal
One techniques create orthogonal representations hidden layers involves bipolar feature coding e coding using rather
Orthogonal patterns tend produce less interference
However learning problems represented using types vectors studies report degree interference still problematic orthogonal vectors
Simple techniques varying learning rate parameters backpropagation equation successful reducing interference
Varying number hidden nodes also used try reduce interference
However findings mixed studies finding hidden units decrease interference studies finding Below number techniques empirical support successfully reducing catastrophic interference backpropagation neural networks Node sharpening technique French proposed catastrophic interference arises feedforward backpropagation networks due interaction node activations activation overlap occur distributed representations hidden layer
Specifically defined activation overlap average shared activation units hidden layer calculated summing lowest activation nodes hidden layer averaging sum
For example activations hidden layer one input activations next input activation overlap would
When using binary representation input vectors activation values indicates activation overlap indicates full activation overlap
French noted neural networks employ localized representations show catastrophic interference lack overlap hidden layer
That say input pattern create hidden layer representation involves activation one node differed inputs activation overlap
Thus suggested reducing value activation overlap hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference distributed networks
Specifically proposed could done changing distributed representations hidden layer semi distributed representations
A semi distributed representation fewer hidden nodes active lower activation value nodes representation make representations different inputs overlap less hidden layer
French recommended could done activation sharpening technique slightly increases activation certain number active nodes hidden layer slightly reduces activation units changes input hidden layer weights reflect activation changes similar error backpropagation
Overall guidelines process activation sharpening follows Perform forward activation pass feeding input input layer hidden layer record activations hidden layer Sharpen activation x number active nodes sharpening factor α Anew Aold α Aold For nodes sharpened e
activated Anew Aold αAold For nodes French suggested number nodes sharpened log n nodes n number hidden layer nodes Use difference old activation Aold sharpened activation Anew error backpropagate error input layer modify weights input output appropriately Do full forward pass input output layer Backpropagate usual output input layer RepeatIn tests input hidden output node backpropagation network one node sharpened French found sharpening paradigm result one node much active seven
Moreover sharpened network took one fourth time relearn initial inputs standard backpropagation without node sharpening
Relearning measure memory savings thus extent forgetting time relearn suggests forgetting Ebbinghaus savings method
A two node sharpened network performed even slightly better however two nodes sharpened forgetting increased
According French sharpened activations interfere less weights network unsharpened weights due specifically way backpropagation algorithm calculates weight changes
Activations near change weights links less activations near
Consequently many nodes low activations due sharpening weights nodes modified much less weights active nodes
As result new input fed network sharpening reduce activation overlap limiting number highly active hidden units reduce likelihood representational overlap reducing number weights changed
Thus node sharpening decrease amount disruption old weights store prior input patterns thereby reducing likelihood catastrophic forgetting
Novelty rule Kortge proposed learning rule training neural networks called novelty rule help alleviate catastrophic interference
As name suggests rule helps neural network learn components new input differ old input
Consequently novelty rule changes weights previously dedicated storing information thereby reducing overlap representations hidden units
Thus even inputs somewhat similar another dissimilar representations made hidden layer
In order apply novelty rule learning input pattern replaced novelty vector represents components differ
The novelty vector first layer input units hidden units determined taking target pattern away current output network delta rule
For second layer hidden units output units novelty vector simply activation hidden units resulted using novelty vector input first layer
Weight changes network computed using modified delta rule novelty vector replacing activation value sum inputs Δwij kδi di Δwij weight change nodes j k learning rate δi error signal di novely vectorWhen novelty rule used standard backpropagation network lessened forgetting old items new items presented sequentially
However rule apply auto encoder auto associative networks target response output layer identical input pattern
This novelty vector would meaningless desired output identical input would impossible calculate much new input differed old input
Pre training networks McRae Hetherington argued humans unlike neural networks take new learning tasks random set weights
Rather people tend bring wealth prior knowledge task helps avoid problem interference
They proposed network pre trained random sample data prior starting sequential learning task prior knowledge naturally constrain new information incorporated
This would occur random sample data domain high degree internal structure English language training would capture regularities recurring patterns found within domain
Since domain based regularities newly learned item tend similar previously learned information allow network incorporate new data little interference existing data
Specifically input vector follows pattern regularities previously trained data cause drastically different pattern activation hidden layer drastically alter weights
To test hypothesis McRae Hetherington compared performance naïve pre trained auto encoder backpropagation network three simulations verbal learning tasks
The pre trained network trained using letter based representations English monosyllabic words English word pairs
All three tasks involved learning consonant vowel consonant CVC strings CVC pairs list A followed training second list items list B
Afterwards distributions hidden node activations compared naïve pre trained network
In three tasks representations CVC naïve network tended spread fairly evenly across hidden nodes whereas hidden nodes inactive pre trained network
Furthermore pre trained network representational overlap CVCs reduced compared naïve network
The pre trained network also retained similarity information representational overlap similar CVCs like JEP ZEP greater dissimilar CVCs JEP YUG
This suggests pre trained network better ability generalize e
notice patterns naïve network
Most importantly reduction hidden unit activation representational overlap resulted significantly less forgetting pre trained network naïve network essentially eliminating catastrophic interference
Essentially pre training acted create internal orthogonalization activations hidden layer reduced interference
Thus pre training simple way reduce catastrophic forgetting standard backpropagation networks
Pseudo recurrent networks French proposed idea pseudo recurrent backpropagation network order help reduce catastrophic interference see Figure
In model network separated two functionally distinct interacting sub networks
This model biologically inspired based research McClelland McNaughton O Reilly
In research McClelland et al
suggested hippocampus neocortex act separable complementary memory systems
Specifically hippocampus short term memory storage acts gradually time transfer memories neocortex long term memory storage
They suggest information stored brought back hippocampus active rehearsal reminiscence sleep renewed activation acts transfer information neocortex time
In pseudo recurrent network one sub networks acts early processing area akin hippocampus functions learn new input patters
The sub network acts final storage area akin neocortex
However unlike McClelland et al
model final storage area sends internally generated representation back early processing area
This creates recurrent network
French proposed interleaving old representations new representations way reduce radical forgetting
Since brain would likely access original input patterns patterns would fed back neocortex would internally generated representations called pseudopatterns
These pseudopatterns approximations previous inputs interleaved learning new inputs
The use pseudopatterns could biologically plausible parallels consolidation learning occurs sleep use interleaved pseudopatterns
Specifically serve integrate new information old information without disruption old information
When given input teacher value fed pseudo recurrent network would act follows When pattern fed environment real input information travels early processing area final storage area however teacher nodes inhibit output final storage area The new pattern learned early processing area standard backpropagation algorithm At time random input also fed network causes pseudopatterns generated final storage area Output final storage area form pseudopatterns used teacher early processing area
In way pseudopatterns interleaved real inputs environment Once new pattern pseudopattern learned early processing area weights copied corresponding weights final storage area When tested sequential learning real world patterns categorization edible poisonous mushrooms pseudo recurrent network shown less interference standard backpropagation network
This improvement memory savings exact recognition old patterns
When activation patterns pseudo recurrent network investigated shown network automatically formed semi distributed representations
Since types representations involve fewer nodes activated pattern likely helped reduce interference
Not pseudo recurrent model show reduced interference also models list length list strength effects seen humans
The list length effect means adding new items list harms memory earlier items
Like humans pseudo recurrent network showed gradual forgetting trained list lengthened
The list strength effect means strength recognition one item increased effect recognition list items
This important finding models often exhibit decrease recognition list items one list item strengthened
Since direct copying weights early processing area final storage area seem highly biologically plausible transfer information final storage area done training final storage area pseudopatterns created early processing area
However disadvantage pseudo recurrent model number hidden units early processing final storage sub networks must identical
Neural networks self refreshing memory Following basic idea contributed Robins Ans Rousset also proposed two network artificial neural architecture memory self refreshing overcomes catastrophic interference sequential learning tasks carried distributed networks trained backpropagation
The principle interleave time new external patterns learned learned new external patterns internally generated pseudopatterns pseudo memories reflect previously learned information
What mainly distinguishes model use classical pseudorehearsal feedforward multilayer networks reverberating process used generating pseudopatterns
This process number activity injections single random seed tends go nonlinear network attractors suitable optimally capturing deep structure previously learned knowledge single feedforward pass random activation
Ans Rousset shown learning mechanism proposed avoiding catastrophic forgetting provides appropriate way deal knowledge transfer measured learning speed ability generalize vulnerability network damages
Musca Rousset Ans also shown pseudopatterns originating artificial reverberating neural network could induce familiarity humans never seen items way predicted simulations conducted two network artificial neural architecture
Furthermore Ans implemented version self refreshing mechanism using one network trained Contrastive Hebbian Learning rule training rule considered realistic largely used backpropagation algorithm fortunately equivalent latter
So far different solutions catastrophic interference presented concern tasks sequential learning involving non temporally ordered lists items
But credible self refreshing mechanism static learning encompass human ability learn serially many temporal sequences patterns without catastrophic interference e g
learning one song followed learning second song without forgetting first one
This done Ans Rousset French Musca presented addition simulation work experiment evidences close similarity behaviour humans behaviour proposed neuromimetic architecture
Latent learning Latent Learning technique used Gutstein Stump mitigate catastrophic interference take advantage transfer learning
Rather manipulating representations new classes used hidden nodes approach tries train optimal representations new classes output nodes
It chooses output encodings least likely catastrophically interfere existing responses
Given net learned discriminate among one set classes using Error Correcting Output Codes ECOC opposed hot codes optimal encodings new classes chosen observing net average responses
Since average responses arose learning original set classes without exposure new classes referred Latently Learned Encodings
This terminology borrows concept Latent Learning introduced Tolman
In effect technique uses transfer learning avoid catastrophic interference making net responses new classes consistent possible existing responses classes already learned
Elastic weight consolidation Kirkpatrick et al
demonstrated method train single artificial neural network multiple tasks using technique called elastic weight consolidation
Anapoiesis Practopoietic theory proposes biological systems solve problem catastrophic interference storing long term memories general form applicable given situation instead loosely applicable class different situations
In order adjust loosely applicable knowledge given current situation process anapoiesis applied
Anapoiesis stands reconstruction knowledge transforming knowledge general form specific one

An expert system divided two subsystems inference engine knowledge base
The knowledge base represents facts rules
The inference engine applies rules known facts deduce new facts
Inference engines also include explanation debugging abilities
History Early development Soon dawn modern computers late early researchers started realizing immense potential machines modern society
One first challenges make machine capable thinking like humans
In particular making machines capable making important decisions way humans
The medical healthcare field presented tantalizing challenge enable machines make medical diagnostic decisions Thus late right information age fully arrived researchers started experimenting prospect using computer technology emulate human decision making
For example biomedical researchers started creating computer aided systems diagnostic applications medicine biology
These early diagnostic systems used patients symptoms laboratory test results inputs generate diagnostic outcome
These systems often described early forms expert systems
However researchers realized significant limitations using traditional methods flow charts statistical pattern matching probability theory
Formal introduction later developments This previous situation gradually led development expert systems used knowledge based approaches
These expert systems medicine MYCIN expert system INTERNIST I expert system later middle CADUCEUS
Expert systems formally introduced around Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led Edward Feigenbaum sometimes termed father expert systems key early contributors Bruce Buchanan Randall Davis
The Stanford researchers tried identify domains expertise highly valued complex diagnosing infectious diseases Mycin identifying unknown organic molecules Dendral
The idea intelligent systems derive power knowledge possess rather specific formalisms inference schemes use Feigenbaum said time significant step forward since past research focused heuristic computational methods culminating attempts develop general purpose problem solvers foremostly conjunct work Allen Newell Herbert Simon
Expert systems became first truly successful forms artificial intelligence AI software Research expert systems also active France
While US focus tended rules based systems first systems hard coded top LISP programming environments expert system shells developed vendors Intellicorp France research focused systems developed Prolog
The advantage expert system shells somewhat easier nonprogrammers use
The advantage Prolog environments focused rules Prolog environments provided much better realization complete first order logic environment In expert systems proliferated
Universities offered expert system courses two thirds Fortune companies applied technology daily business activities

In first IBM PC PC DOS operating system introduced
The imbalance high affordability relatively powerful chips PC compared much expensive cost processing power mainframes dominated corporate IT world time created new type architecture corporate computing termed client server model
Calculations reasoning could performed fraction price mainframe using PC
This model also enabled business units bypass corporate IT departments directly build applications
As result client server tremendous impact expert systems market
Expert systems already outliers much business world requiring new skills many IT departments eager develop
They natural fit new PC based shells promised put application development hands end users experts

The first expert system used design capacity large scale product SID Synthesis Integral Design software program developed
Written LISP SID generated VAX CPU logic gates
Input software set rules created several expert logic designers
SID expanded rules generated software logic synthesis routines many times size rules
Surprisingly combination rules resulted overall design exceeded capabilities experts many cases performed human counterparts
While rules contradicted others top level control parameters speed area provided tie breaker
The program highly controversial used nevertheless due project budget constraints
It terminated logic designers VAX project completion
During years middle expectations expert systems accomplish many fields tended extremely optimistic
At beginning early studies researchers hoping develop entirely automatic e completely computerized expert systems
The expectations people computers frequently idealistic
This situation radically changed Richard M Karp published breakthrough paper Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems early
Thanks Karp work became clear certain limitations possibilities one designs computer algorithms
His findings describe computers cannot
Many computational problems related type expert systems certain pragmatic limitations
These findings laid groundwork led next developments field
In beyond term expert system idea standalone AI system mostly dropped IT lexicon
There two interpretations
One expert systems failed IT world moved expert systems deliver hyped promise
The mirror opposite expert systems simply victims success IT professionals grasped concepts rule engines tools migrated standalone tools developing special purpose expert systems one many standard tools
Many leading major business application suite vendors SAP Siebel Oracle integrated expert system abilities suite products way specifying business logic rule engines longer simply defining rules expert would use type complex volatile critical business logic often go hand hand business process automation integration environments
Current approaches expert systems The limitations previous type expert systems urged researchers develop new types approaches
They developed efficient flexible powerful approaches order emulate human decision making process
Some approaches researchers developed based new methods artificial intelligence AI particular machine learning data mining approaches feedback mechanism
Related discussion disadvantages section
Modern systems incorporate new knowledge easily thus update easily
Such systems generalize existing knowledge better deal vast amounts complex data
Related subject big data
Sometimes type expert systems called intelligent systems Software architecture An expert system example knowledge based system
Expert systems first commercial systems use knowledge based architecture
A knowledge based system essentially composed two sub systems knowledge base inference engine The knowledge base represents facts world
In early expert systems Mycin Dendral facts represented mainly flat assertions variables
In later expert systems developed commercial shells knowledge base took structure used concepts object oriented programming
The world represented classes subclasses instances assertions replaced values object instances
The rules worked querying asserting values objects
The inference engine automated reasoning system evaluates current state knowledge base applies relevant rules asserts new knowledge knowledge base
The inference engine may also include abilities explanation explain user chain reasoning used arrive particular conclusion tracing back firing rules resulted assertion There mainly two modes inference engine forward chaining backward chaining
The different approaches dictated whether inference engine driven antecedent left hand side consequent right hand side rule
In forward chaining antecedent fires asserts consequent
For example consider following rule A simple example forward chaining would assert Man Socrates system trigger inference engine
It would match R assert Mortal Socrates knowledge base
Backward chaining bit less straight forward
In backward chaining system looks possible conclusions works backward see might true
So system trying determine Mortal Socrates true would find R query knowledge base see Man Socrates true
One early innovations expert systems shells integrate inference engines user interface
This could especially powerful backward chaining
If system needs know particular fact simply generate input screen ask user information known
So example could use R ask user Socrates Man use new information accordingly
The use rules explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities
In simple example system used R assert Socrates Mortal user wished understand Socrates mortal could query system system would look back rules fired cause assertion present rules user explanation
In English user asked Why Socrates Mortal
system would reply Because men mortal Socrates man
A significant area research generation explanations knowledge base natural English rather simply showing formal less intuitive rules As expert systems evolved many new techniques incorporated various types inference engines
Some important Truth maintenance
These systems record dependencies knowledge base facts altered dependent knowledge altered accordingly
For example system learns Socrates longer known man revoke assertion Socrates mortal
Hypothetical reasoning
In knowledge base divided many possible views k
worlds
This allows inference engine explore multiple possibilities parallel
For example system may want explore consequences assertions true Socrates Man true
Uncertainty systems
One first extensions simply using rules represent knowledge also associate probability rule
So assert Socrates mortal assert Socrates may mortal probability value
Simple probabilities extended systems sophisticated mechanisms uncertain reasoning Fuzzy logic combination probabilities
Ontology classification
With addition object classes knowledge base new type reasoning possible
Along reasoning simply object values system could also reason object structures
In simple example Man represent object class R redefined rule defines class men
These types special purpose inference engines termed classifiers
Although highly used expert systems classifiers powerful unstructured volatile domains key technology Internet emerging Semantic Web
Advantages The goal knowledge based systems make critical information required system work explicit rather implicit
In traditional computer program logic embedded code typically reviewed IT specialist
With expert system goal specify rules format intuitive easily understood reviewed even edited domain experts rather IT experts
The benefits explicit knowledge representation rapid development ease maintenance
Ease maintenance obvious benefit
This achieved two ways
First removing need write conventional code many normal problems caused even small changes system could avoided expert systems
Essentially logical flow program least highest level simply given system simply invoke inference engine
This also reason second benefit rapid prototyping
With expert system shell possible enter rules prototype developed days rather months year typically associated complex IT projects
A claim expert system shells often made removed need trained programmers experts could develop systems
In reality seldom ever true
While rules expert system comprehensible typical computer code still formal syntax misplaced comma character could cause havoc computer language
Also expert systems moved prototypes lab deployment business world issues integration maintenance became far critical
Inevitably demands integrate take advantage large legacy databases systems arose
To accomplish integration required skills type system
Disadvantages The common disadvantage cited expert systems academic literature knowledge acquisition problem
Obtaining time domain experts software application always difficult expert systems especially difficult experts definition highly valued constant demand organization
As result problem great deal research later years expert systems focused tools knowledge acquisition help automate process designing debugging maintaining rules defined experts
However looking life cycle expert systems actual use problems essentially problems large system seem least critical knowledge acquisition integration access large databases performance Performance could especially problematic early expert systems built using tools earlier Lisp versions interpreted code expressions without first compiling
This provided powerful development environment drawback virtually impossible match efficiency fastest compiled languages C
System database integration difficult early expert systems tools mostly languages platforms neither familiar welcome corporate IT environments programming languages Lisp Prolog hardware platforms Lisp machines personal computers
As result much effort later stages expert system tool development focused integrating legacy environments COBOL large database systems porting standard platforms
These issues resolved mainly client server paradigm shift PCs gradually accepted IT environment legitimate platform serious business system development affordable minicomputer servers provided processing power needed AI applications Another major challenge expert systems emerges size knowledge base increases
This causes processing complexity increase
For instance expert system million rules envisioned ultimate expert system became obvious system would complex would face many computational problems
An inference engine would able process huge numbers rules reach decision
How verify decision rules consistent also challenge many rules
Usually problem leads satisfiability SAT formulation
This well known NP complete problem Boolean satisfiability problem
If assume binary variables say n corresponding search space size n displaystyle n
Thus search space grow exponentially
There also questions prioritize use rules order operate efficiently resolve ambiguities instance many else sub structures within single rule Other problems related overfitting overgeneralization effects using known facts trying generalize cases described explicitly knowledge base
Such problems exist methods employ machine learning approaches
Another problem related knowledge base make updates knowledge quickly effectively
Also add new piece knowledge e add among many rules challenging
Modern approaches rely machine learning methods easier regard
Because challenges became clear new approaches AI required instead rule based technologies
These new approaches based use machine learning techniques along use feedback mechanisms The key challenges expert systems medicine one considers computer aided diagnostic systems modern expert systems perhaps application domains include issues related aspects big data existing regulations healthcare practice various algorithmic issues system assessment

In field artificial intelligence neuro fuzzy refers combinations artificial neural networks fuzzy logic
Overview Neuro fuzzy hybridization results hybrid intelligent system synergizes two techniques combining human like reasoning style fuzzy systems learning connectionist structure neural networks
Neuro fuzzy hybridization widely termed fuzzy neural network FNN neuro fuzzy system NFS literature
Neuro fuzzy system popular term used henceforth incorporates human like reasoning style fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets linguistic model consisting set IF THEN fuzzy rules
The main strength neuro fuzzy systems universal approximators ability solicit interpretable IF THEN rules
The strength neuro fuzzy systems involves two contradictory requirements fuzzy modeling interpretability versus accuracy
In practice one two properties prevails
The neuro fuzzy fuzzy modeling research field divided two areas linguistic fuzzy modeling focused interpretability mainly Mamdani model precise fuzzy modeling focused accuracy mainly Takagi Sugeno Kang TSK model

The Knowledge Based Software Assistant KBSA research program funded United States Air Force
The goal program apply concepts artificial intelligence problem designing implementing computer software
Software would described models high level languages essentially equivalent first order logic transformation rules would transform specification efficient code
The air force hoped able generate software control weapons systems command control systems using method
As software becoming ever critical USAF weapons systems realized improving quality productivity software development process could significant benefits military well information technology major US industries
History In early United States Air Force realized received significant benefits applying artificial intelligence technologies solving expert problems diagnosis faults aircraft
The air force commissioned group researchers artificial intelligence formal methods communities develop report technologies might used aid general problem software development
The report described vision new approach software development
Rather define specifications diagrams manually transform code current process Knowledge Based Software Assistant KBSA vision define specifications high level languages use transformation rules gradually refine specification efficient code heterogeneous platforms
Each step design refinement system would recorded part integrated repository
In addition artifacts software development processes various definitions transformations would also recorded way could analyzed also replayed later needed
The idea step would transformation took account various non functional requirements implemented system
For example requirements use specific programming languages Ada harden code real time mission critical fault tolerance The air force decided fund research vision Rome Air Development Center laboratory Griffiss air force base New York
The majority early research conducted Kestrel Institute Northern California Stanford University Information Sciences Institute ISI Southern California USC UCLA
The Kestrel Institute focused primarily provably correct transformation logical models efficient code
ISI focused primarily front end process defining specifications could map logical formalisms formats intuitive familiar systems analysts
In addition Raytheon project investigate informal requirements gathering Honeywell Harvard University work underlying frameworks integration activity coordination
Although primarily funded KBSA program MIT Programmer Apprentice project also many goals used techniques KBSA In later stages KBSA program starting researchers developed prototypes used medium large scale software development problems
Also later stages emphasis shifted pure KBSA approach general questions use knowledge based technology supplement augment existing future computer aided software engineering CASE tools
In later stages significant interaction KBSA community object oriented software engineering communities
For example KBSA concepts researchers played important role mega programming user centered software engineering programs sponsored Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA
In later stages program changed name Knowledge Based Software Engineering KBSE
The name change reflected different research goal longer create totally new encompassing tool would cover complete software life cycle gradually work knowledge based technology existing tools
Companies Andersen Consulting one largest system integrators time vendor CASE tool played major role program later stages
Key concepts Transformation rules The transformation rules KBSA used different traditional rules expert systems
Transformation rules matched specification implementation languages rather facts world
It possible specify transformations using patterns wildcards recursion right left hand sides rule
The left hand expression would specify patterns existing knowledge base search
The right hand expression could specify new pattern transform left hand side
For example transform set theoretic data type code using Ada set library The initial purpose transformation rules refine high level logical specification well designed code specific hardware software platform
This inspired early work theorem proving automatic programming
However researchers Information Sciences Institute ISI developed concept evolution transformations
Rather transforming specification code evolution transformation meant automate various stereotypical changes specification level example developing new superclass extracting various capabilities existing class shared generally
Evolution transformations developed approximately time emergence software patterns community two groups shared concepts technology
Evolution transformations essentially known refactoring object oriented software patterns community
Knowledge based repository A key concept KBSA artifacts requirements specifications transformations designs code process models etc
represented objects knowledge based repository
The original KBSA report describes called Wide Spectrum Language
The requirement knowledge representation framework could support entire life cycle requirements specification code well software process
The core representation knowledge base meant utilize framework although various layers could added support specific presentations implementations
These early knowledge base frameworks developed primarily ISI Kestrel building top Lisp Lisp machine environments
The Kestrel environment eventually turned commercial product called Refine developed supported spin company Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated
The Refine language environment also proved applicable problem software reverse engineering taking legacy code critical business lacks proper documentation using tools analyze transform maintainable form
With growing concern Y K problem reverse engineering major business concern many large US corporations focus area KBSA research There significant interaction KBSA communities Frame language object oriented communities
The early KBSA knowledge bases implemented object based languages rather object oriented
Objects represented classes sub classes possible define methods objects
In later versions KBSA Andersen Consulting Concept Demo specification language expanded support message passing well
Intelligent Assistant KBSA took different approach traditional expert systems came solve problems work users
In traditional expert system approach user answers series interactive questions system provides solution
The KBSA approach left user control
Where expert system tried extent replace remove need expert intelligent assistant approach KBSA sought invent process technology
This led number innovations user interface level
An example collaboration object oriented community KBSA architecture used KBSA user interfaces
KBSA systems utilized model view controller MVC user interface
This idea incorporated Smalltalk environments
The MVC architecture especially well suited KBSA user interface
KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views knowledge base
It might useful look emerging model standpoint entities relations object interactions class hierarchies dataflow many possible views
The MVC architecture facilitated
With MVC architecture underlying model always knowledge base meta model description specification implementation languages
When analyst made change via particular diagram e g
added class class hierarchy change made underlying model level various views model automatically updated One benefits using transformation many aspects specification implementation could modified
For small scale prototypes resulting diagrams simple enough basic layout algorithms combined reliance users clean diagrams sufficient
However transformation radically redraw models tens even hundreds nodes links constant updating various views becomes task
Researchers Andersen Consulting incorporated work University Illinois graph theory automatically update various views associated knowledge base generate graphs minimal intersection links also take account domain user specific layout constraints
Another concept used provide intelligent assistance automatic text generation
Early research ISI investigated feasibility extracting formal specifications informal natural language text documents
They determined approach viable
Natural language nature simply ambiguous serve good format defining system
However natural language generation seen feasible way generate textual descriptions could read managers non technical personnel
This especially appealing air force since law required contractors generate various reports describe system different points view
Researchers ISI later Cogentext Andersen Consulting demonstrated viability approach using technology generate documentation required air force contracts

Artificial intelligence video surveillance utilizes computer software programs analyze audio images video surveillance cameras order recognize humans vehicles objects events
Security contractors program software define restricted areas within camera view fenced area parking lot sidewalk public street outside lot program times day close business property protected camera surveillance
The artificial intelligence A I
sends alert detects trespasser breaking rule set person allowed area time day
The A I
program functions using machine vision
Machine vision series algorithms mathematical procedures work like flow chart series questions compare object seen hundreds thousands stored reference images humans different postures angles positions movements
The A I
asks observed object moves like reference images whether approximately size height relative width characteristic two arms two legs moves similar speed vertical instead horizontal
Many questions possible degree object reflective degree steady vibrating smoothness moves
Combining values various questions overall ranking derived gives A I
probability object human
If value exceeds limit set alert sent
It characteristic programs self learning degree learning example humans vehicles appear bigger certain portions monitored image areas near camera portions areas farthest camera
In addition simple rule restricting humans vehicles certain areas certain times day complex rules set
The user system may wish know vehicles drive one direction
Users may wish know certain preset number people within particular area
The A I
capable maintaining surveillance hundreds cameras simultaneously
Its ability spot trespasser distance rain glare superior humans ability
This type A I
security known rule based human programmer must set rules things user wishes alerted
This prevalent form A I
security
Many video surveillance camera systems today include type A I
capability
The hard drive houses program either located cameras separate device receives input cameras
A newer non rule based form A I
security called behavioral analytics developed
This software fully self learning initial programming input user security contractor
In type analytics A I
learns normal behavior people vehicles machines environment based observation patterns various characteristics size speed reflectivity color grouping vertical horizontal orientation forth
The A I
normalizes visual data meaning classifies tags objects patterns observes building continuously refined definitions normal average behavior various observed objects
After several weeks learning fashion recognize things break pattern
When observes anomalies sends alert
For example normal cars drive street
A car seen driving onto sidewalk would anomaly
If fenced yard normally empty night person entering area would anomaly
History Statement problem Limitations ability humans vigilantly monitor video surveillance live footage led demand artificial intelligence could better serve task
Humans watching single video monitor twenty minutes lose ability maintain attention sufficient discern significant events
With two monitors cut half
Given many facilities dozens even hundreds cameras task clearly beyond human ability
In general camera views empty hallways storage facilities parking lots structures exceedingly boring thus attention quickly attenuated
When multiple cameras monitored typically employing wall monitor bank monitors split screen views rotating every several seconds one set cameras next visual tedium quickly overwhelming
While video surveillance cameras proliferated great adoption users ranging car dealerships shopping plazas schools businesses highly secured facilities nuclear plants recognized hindsight video surveillance human officers also called operators impractical ineffective
Extensive video surveillance systems relegated merely recording possible forensic use identify someone fact theft arson attack incident
Where wide angle camera views employed particularly large outdoor areas severe limitations discovered even purpose due insufficient resolution
In cases impossible identify trespasser perpetrator image tiny monitor
Earlier attempts solution Motion detection cameras In response shortcomings human guards watch surveillance monitors long term first solution add motion detectors cameras
It reasoned intruder perpetrator motion would send alert remote monitoring officer obviating need constant human vigilance
The problem outdoor environment constant motion changes pixels comprise total viewed image screen
The motion leaves trees blowing wind litter along ground insects birds dogs shadows headlights sunbeams forth comprise motion
This caused hundreds even thousands false alerts per day rendering solution inoperable except indoor environments times non operating hours
Advanced video motion detection The next evolution reduced false alerts degree cost complicated time consuming manual calibration
Here changes target person vehicle relative fixed background detected
Where background changes seasonally due changes reliability deteriorates time
The economics responding many false alerts proved obstacle solution sufficient
Advent true video analytics Machine learning visual recognition relates patterns classification
True video analytics distinguish human form vehicles boats selected objects general movement objects visual static changes pixels monitor
It recognizing patterns
When object interest example human violates preset rule example number people shall exceed zero pre defined area defined time interval alert sent
A red rectangle called bounding box typically automatically follow detected intruder short video clip sent alert
Practical application Real time preventative action The detection intruders using video surveillance limitations based economics nature video cameras
Typically cameras outdoors set wide angle view yet look long distance
Frame rate per second dynamic range handle brightly lit areas dimly lit ones challenge camera actually adequate see moving human intruder
At night even illuminated outdoor areas moving subject gather enough light per frame per second unless quite close camera appear thin wisp barely discernible ghost completely invisible
Conditions glare partial obscuration rain snow fog darkness compound problem
Even human directed look actual location monitor subject conditions subject usually detected
The A I
able impartially look entire image cameras images simultaneously
Using statistical models degrees deviation learned pattern constitutes human form detect intruder high reliability low false alert rate even adverse conditions
Its learning based approximately quarter million images humans various positions angles postures forth
A one megapixel camera onboard video analytics able detect human distance angle view degrees non ideal conditions
Rules could set virtual fence intrusion pre defined area
Rules could set directional travel object left behind crowd formation conditions
Artificial intelligence video surveillance widely use din China
See Mass surveillance China
Talk One powerful features system human officer operator receiving alert A I could immediately talk outdoor public address loudspeakers intruder
This high deterrence value crimes opportunistic risk capture intruder becomes pronounced live person talking likely desist intrusion retreat
The security officer would describe actions intruder intruder doubt real person watching
The officer would announce intruder breaking law law enforcement contacted video recorded
Verified breach report The police receive tremendous number false alarms burglar alarms
In fact security industry reports alarms false ones
Accordingly police give low priority response burglar alarms take twenty minutes two hours respond site
By contrast video analytic detected crime reported central monitoring officer verifies eyes real crime progress
He dispatches police give calls highest priority
Continuing advances Analytics work digital cameras analog cameras analog digital converters
Various companies aside VideoIQ Avigilon offer video analytics
In many cases software samples standard definition less regardless camera resolution
The advance achieved Avigilon true analytics exceedingly high resolution megapixel cameras
Behavioral analytics Active environments While rule based video analytics worked economically reliably many security applications many situations cannot work
For indoor outdoor area one belongs certain times day example overnight areas one belongs time cell tower traditional rule based analytics perfectly appropriate
In example cell tower rare time service technician may need access area would simply require calling pass code put monitoring response test inactivated brief time authorized person
But many security needs active environments hundreds thousands people belong place time
For example college campus active factory hospital active operating facility
It possible set rules would discriminate legitimate people criminals wrong doers
Overcoming problem active environments Using behavioral analytics self learning non rule based A I
takes data video cameras continuously classifies objects events sees
For example person crossing street one classification
A group people another classification
A vehicle one classification continued learning public bus would discriminated small truck motorcycle
With increasing sophistication system recognizes patterns human behavior
For example might observe individuals pass controlled access door one time
The door opens person presents proximity card tag person passes door closes
This pattern activity observed repeatedly forms basis normal view camera observing scene
Now authorized person opens door second tail gating unauthorized person grabs door closes passes sort anomaly would create alert
This type analysis much complex rule based analytics
While rule based analytics work mainly detect intruders areas one normally present defined times day behavioral analytics works people active detect things ordinary
A fire breaking outdoors would unusual event would cause alert would rising cloud smoke
Vehicles driving wrong way one way driveway would also typify type event strong visual signature would deviate repeatedly observed pattern vehicles driving correct one way lane
Someone thrown ground attacker would unusual event would likely cause alert
This situation specific
So camera viewed gymnasium wrestling practiced A I
would learn usual one human throw another ground case would alert observation
What artificial intelligence understands The A I
know understand human fire vehicle
It simply finding characteristics things based size shape color reflectivity angle orientation motion
It finds objects classified typical patterns behavior
For example humans walk sidewalks sometimes streets climb sides buildings often
Vehicles drive streets drive sidewalks
Thus anomalous behavior someone scaling building vehicle veering onto sidewalk would trigger alert
Varies traditional mindset security systems Typical alarm systems designed miss true positives real crime events low false alarm rate possible
In regard burglar alarms miss true positives high false alarm rate even controlled indoor environment
Motion detecting cameras miss true positives plagued overwhelming false alarms outdoor environment
Rule based analytics reliably detect true positives low rate false positives cannot perform active environments empty ones
Also limited simple discrimination whether intruder present
Something complex subtle fight breaking employee breaking safety procedure possible rule based analytics detect discriminate
With behavioral analytics
Places people moving working present problem
However A I
may spot many things appear anomalous innocent nature
For example students campus walk plaza learned normal
If couple students decided carry large sheet outdoors flapping wind might indeed trigger alert
The monitoring officer would alerted look monitor would see event threat would ignore
The degree deviation norm triggers alert set abnormal things reported
However still constitutes new way human A I
interaction typified traditional alarm industry mindset
This many false alarms may nevertheless valuable send human officer quickly look determine scene requires response
In sense tap shoulder A I
human look something
Limitations behavioral analytics Because many complex things processed continuously software samples low resolution CIF conserve computational demand
The CIF resolution means object size human detected camera utilized wide angle human sixty eighty feet distant depending conditions
Larger objects like vehicles smoke would detectable greater distances
Quantification situational awareness The utility artificial intelligence security exist vacuum development driven purely academic scientific study
Rather addressed real world needs hence economic forces
Its use non security applications operational efficiency shopper heat mapping display areas meaning many people certain area retail space attendance classes developing uses
Humans well qualified A I
compile recognize patterns consisting large data sets requiring simultaneous calculations multiple remote viewed locations
There nothing natively human awareness
Such multi tasking shown defocus human attention performance
A I ability handle data
For purposes security interacting video cameras functionally better visual acuity humans machine approximation
For judging subtleties behaviors intentions subjects degrees threat humans remain far superior present state technology
So A I
security functions broadly scan beyond human capability vet data first level sorting relevance alert human officer takes function assessment response
Security practical world economically determined expenditure preventative security never typically exceed perceived cost risk avoided
Studies shown companies typically spend one twenty fifth amount security actual losses cost
What pure economic theory equivalence homeostasis thus falls vastly short
One theory explains cognitive dissonance ease unpleasant things like risk shunted conscious mind
Nevertheless security major expenditure comparison costs different means security always foremost amongst security professionals
Another reason future security threats losses assessed often direct cost potential loss considered instead spectrum consequential losses concomitantly experienced
For example vandalism destruction custom production machine factory refrigerated tractor trailer would result long replacement time customers could served resulting loss business
A violent crime extensive public relations damage employer beyond direct liability failing protect employee
Behavioral analytics uniquely functions beyond simple security due ability observe breaches standard patterns protocols effectively find unsafe acts employees may result workers comp public liability incidents
Here assessment future incidents costs falls short reality
A study Liberty Mutual Insurance Company showed cost employers six times direct insured cost since uninsured costs consequential damages include temporary replacement workers hiring costs replacements training costs managers time reports court adverse morale workers effect customer public relations
The potential A I
form behavioral analytics proactively intercept prevent incidents significant

Introduction In study decision making including disciplines psychology artificial intelligence management science fast frugal tree type classification tree decision tree
As shown Figure explained detail later fast frugal trees simple graphical structures ask one question time
The goal classify object Figure patient suspected heart disease category purpose making decision Figure two possibilities patient assigned regular nursing bed emergency care
Unlike classification decision trees Leo Breiman CART fast frugal trees defined intentionally simple construction well execution operate speedily little information
For example tree Figure asks one maximum three questions
Fast frugal trees introduced conceptualized Laura Martignon Vitouch Takezawa Forster constitute family simple heuristics tradition Gerd Gigerenzer Herbert A Simon view formal models heuristics
Before term fast frugal trees coined models heuristics used several contexts without explicitly conceptualized defined GM MH DA DH FZBM
In tasks binary decision classification needs made e g doctor decide whether assign patient severe chest pain coronary care unit regular nursery bed cues terminology used psychology called features artificial intelligence attributes management science available making decision FFT defined follows A fast frugal tree decision tree exits one exit first cues two exits last cue
Mathematically fast frugal trees viewed lexicographic heuristics linear models non compensatory weights proven Martignon Katsikopoulos Woike MKW
Their formal properties construction also analyzed using signal detection theory Luan Schooler Gigerenzer LSG
How fast frugal tree works This section describes construct use fast frugal tree
Construction Recall basic elements making binary classification cues assumed binary
In fast frugal tree cues ranked one cue level tree exit node level except two exit nodes last cue last level tree
Whenever cue used question asked value cue
The answers questions might immediately lead exit might lead question eventually exit
A characteristic property fast frugal trees question least one possible answer leads exit
In literature fast frugal trees many different algorithms proposed MKW LSG ordering cues deciding possible answer question cue leads immediately exit
Note done fast frugal tree fully defined
Often order keep construction simple intuitive algorithms use simple measures cue goodness e g correlation cue category considering cue independently cues make simple choices exits e g decide exit independently exits complex algorithms proposed well
Execution To use fast frugal tree begin root check one cue time
At step one possible outcomes exit node allows decision action exit reached stop otherwise continue exit reached
take exit stop othersise continue ask questions exit reached
Figure illustrates fast frugal tree classifying patient high risk heart stroke thus sent coronary care unit low risk thus sent regular nursing bed GM Green Mehr
Consider three patients John Mary Jack John ST segment changes thus classified high risk sent coronary care unit without considering cues
Mary ST segment changes chest pain chief complaint remaining five factors thus classified low risk sent regular nursing bed three cues checked
Jack ST segment change chest pain chief complaint thus classified low risk sent regular nursing bed considering two cues
Performance The accuracy robustness fast frugal trees shown comparable Bayesian benchmarks studies Laskey Martignon LM
Extensive studies comparing performance fast frugal trees classification algorithms used statistics machine learning Naive Bayes CART random forests logistic regression also carried using dozens real world datasets WHM MKW
A Signal Detection Analysis Fast frugal Trees Fast frugal trees used perform binary classifications decisions
In psychology medicine fields signal detection theory detection theory classic theory tasks analyzed
The theory assumes two categories events people e g people without heart problems category relevant us referred signal referred noise The two differ distribution observation scale may call evidence signal distribution higher mean
One make two possible classifications namely signal noise upon gathering evidence
This leads four possible outcomes hit classify signal indeed signal correct rejection classify noise indeed noise miss classify noise actually signal false alarm classify signal actually noise
To maximize overall accuracy expected value classification theory posits need carefully select classification criterion evidence scale make signal decision noise Specially cost miss high e classifying patient heart problem normal lower liberal criterion e toward left evidence scale needs selected whereas cost false alarm high e g classifying innocent person guilty murder higher conservative criterion better
This implies good decision maker needs properly biased real world situations critical relevant insight signal detection theory classification decision making
In Luan Schooler Gigerenzer analyzed characteristics fast frugal trees perspective signal detection theory
There several key findings analysis
First choice exit structure fast frugal tree corresponds setting decision criterion signal detection
In nutshell earlier signal exit appears fast frugal tree liberally biased tree
The relative biases two fast frugal trees determined first exit two differ one signal exit denoted always liberal one noise exit denoted n Figure
For example FFTsnnn Signal exit n noise exit liberally biased FFTnsss
This principle referred lexicographic decision bias fast frugal trees
Second series simulations show fast frugal trees different exit structures lead different sometimes drastically different expected value decision consequences miss false alarm differ
Therefore constructing applying fast frugal tree one needs choose exit structure matches well decision payoff structure task
Third overall sensitivity fast frugal tree well tree discriminate signal noise measured A signal detection theory affected properties cues make tree mean variance cues sensitivities inter cue correlations among cues much exit structure tree
And finally performance fast frugal trees robust comparable much sophisticated decision algorithms developed signal detection theory including ideal observer analysis model optimal sequential sampling model
In context sample predictions fast frugal trees perform best relative models learning sample size relatively small e g less trials
Computing Support In Phillips Neth Woike Gaissmaier PNWG introduced R package FFTrees hosted CRAN accompanying app constructs depicts graphically evaluates quantitatively fast frugal trees user friendly ways
More Examples Fast frugal Trees There many applications fast frugal trees prescribing decision made describing people actually make decisions
Beyond medical field example prescriptive applications instructing soldiers stationed Afghanistan distinguish whether car approaching check point driven civilians potential suicide bombers KK tree illustrated Figure
Two examples fast frugal trees descriptive uses shown Figure
The trees left right describe respectively person decides whether forgive another person offense latter committed social interactions TLK British judges make bail jail decision D
In general fast frugal trees applied help model binary decision making processes involve multiple cues

This leads improved tendency reduce excitation
The following interpretation obvious based biological swarm behavior Each individual tends follow rule reduce excitation
It remains free decision nothing step follow rule disregard step

In natural language processing open information extraction OIE task generating structured machine readable representation information text usually form triples n ary propositions
Overview A proposition understood truth bearer textual expression potential fact e g Dante wrote Divine Comedy represented amenable structure computers e g Dante wrote Divine Comedy
An OIE extraction normally consists relation set arguments
For instance Dante passed away Ravenna proposition formed relation passed away arguments Dante Ravenna
The first argument usually referred subject second considered object The extraction said textual representation potential fact elements linked knowledge base
Furthermore factual nature proposition yet established
In example transforming extraction full fledged fact would first require linking possible relation arguments knowledge base
Second truth extraction would need determined
In computer science transforming OIE extractions ontological facts known relation extraction
In fact OIE seen first step wide range deeper text understanding tasks relation extraction knowledge base construction question answering semantic role labeling
The extracted propositions also directly used end user applications structured search e g retrieve propositions Dante subject
OIE first introduced TextRunner developed University Washington Turing Center headed Oren Etzioni
Other methods introduced later Reverb OLLIE ClausIE CSD helped shape OIE task characterizing aspects
At high level approaches make use set patterns generate extractions
Depending particular approach patterns either hand crafted learned
OIE systems contributions Reverb suggested necessity produce meaningful relations accurately capture information input text
For instance given sentence Faust made pact devil would erroneous produce extraction Faust made pact since would adequately informative
A precise extraction would Faust made pact devil
Reverb also argued generation overspecific relations
OLLIE stressed two important aspects OIE
First pointed lack factuality propositions
For instance sentence like If John studies hard pass exam would inaccurate consider John pass exam fact
Additionally authors indicated OIE system able extract non verb mediated relations account significant portion information expressed natural language text
For instance sentence Obama former US president born Hawaii OIE system able recognize proposition Obama former US president
ClausIE introduced connection grammatical clauses propositions OIE extractions
The authors stated grammatical clause expresses proposition verb mediated proposition identified solely recognizing set clauses expressed sentence
This implies correctly recognize set propositions input sentence necessary understand grammatical structure
The authors studied case English language admits seven clause types meaning identification proposition requires defining seven grammatical patterns
The finding also established separation recognition propositions materialization
In first step proposition identified without consideration final form domain independent unsupervised way mostly based linguistic principles
In second step information represented according requirements underlying application without conditioning identification phase
Consider sentence Albert Einstein born Ulm died Princeton
The first step recognize two propositions Albert Einstein born Ulm Albert Einstein died Princeton
Once information correctly identified propositions take particular form required underlying application e g Albert Einstein born Ulm Albert Einstein died Princeton
CSD introduced idea minimality OIE
It considers computers make better use extractions expressed compact way
This especially important sentences subordinate clauses
In cases CSD suggests generation nested extractions
For example consider sentence The Embassy said Americans Pakistan
CSD generates two extractions Americans Pakistan ii The Embassy said
This usually known reification

Newly minted terms highly attitudinal volatile polarity often known vocabulary
Types A basic task sentiment analysis classifying polarity given text document sentence feature aspect level whether expressed opinion document sentence entity feature aspect positive negative neutral
Advanced beyond polarity sentiment classification looks instance emotional states angry sad happy Precursors sentimental analysis include General Inquirer provided hints toward quantifying patterns text separately psychological research examined person psychological state based analysis verbal behavior Subsequently method described patent Volcani Fogel looked specifically sentiment identified individual words phrases text respect different emotional scales
A current system based work called EffectCheck presents synonyms used increase decrease level evoked emotion scale
Many subsequent efforts less sophisticated using mere polar view sentiment positive negative work Turney Pang applied different methods detecting polarity product reviews movie reviews respectively
This work document level
One also classify document polarity multi way scale attempted Pang Snyder among others Pang Lee expanded basic task classifying movie review either positive negative predict star ratings either star scale Snyder performed depth analysis restaurant reviews predicting ratings various aspects given restaurant food atmosphere five star scale
First steps bringing together various approaches learning lexical knowledge based etc taken AAAI Spring Symposium linguists computer scientists interested researchers first aligned interests proposed shared tasks benchmark data sets systematic computational research affect appeal subjectivity sentiment text Even though statistical classification methods neutral class ignored assumption neutral texts lie near boundary binary classifier several researchers suggest every polarity problem three categories must identified
Moreover proven specific classifiers Max Entropy SVMs benefit introduction neutral class improve overall accuracy classification
There principle two ways operating neutral class
Either algorithm proceeds first identifying neutral language filtering assessing rest terms positive negative sentiments builds three way classification one step
This second approach often involves estimating probability distribution categories e g
naive Bayes classifiers implemented NLTK
Whether use neutral class depends nature data data clearly clustered neutral negative positive language makes sense filter neutral language focus polarity positive negative sentiments
If contrast data mostly neutral small deviations towards positive negative affect strategy would make harder clearly distinguish two poles
A different method determining sentiment use scaling system whereby words commonly associated negative neutral positive sentiment given associated number scale negative positive simply positive upper limit
This makes possible adjust sentiment given term relative environment usually level sentence
When piece unstructured text analyzed using natural language processing concept specified environment given score based way sentiment words relate concept associated score
This allows movement sophisticated understanding sentiment possible adjust sentiment value concept relative modifications may surround
Words example intensify relax negate sentiment expressed concept affect score
Alternatively texts given positive negative sentiment strength score goal determine sentiment text rather overall polarity strength text
Subjectivity objectivity identification This task commonly defined classifying given text usually sentence one two classes objective subjective
This problem sometimes difficult polarity classification
The subjectivity words phrases may depend context objective document may contain subjective sentences e g news article quoting people opinions
Moreover mentioned Su results largely dependent definition subjectivity used annotating texts
However Pang showed removing objective sentences document classifying polarity helped improve performance
Feature aspect based It refers determining opinions sentiments expressed different features aspects entities e g cell phone digital camera bank
A feature aspect attribute component entity e g screen cell phone service restaurant picture quality camera
The advantage feature based sentiment analysis possibility capture nuances objects interest
Different features generate different sentiment responses example hotel convenient location mediocre food
This problem involves several sub problems e g identifying relevant entities extracting features aspects determining whether opinion expressed feature aspect positive negative neutral
The automatic identification features performed syntactic methods topic modeling deep learning
More detailed discussions level sentiment analysis found Liu work
Methods features Existing approaches sentiment analysis grouped three main categories knowledge based techniques statistical methods hybrid approaches
Knowledge based techniques classify text affect categories based presence unambiguous affect words happy sad afraid bored
Some knowledge bases list obvious affect words also assign arbitrary words probable affinity particular emotions
Statistical methods leverage elements machine learning latent semantic analysis support vector machines bag words Pointwise Mutual Information Semantic Orientation deep learning
More sophisticated methods try detect holder sentiment e person maintains affective state target e entity affect felt
To mine opinion context get feature speaker opined grammatical relationships words used
Grammatical dependency relations obtained deep parsing text
Hybrid approaches leverage machine learning elements knowledge representation ontologies semantic networks order detect semantics expressed subtle manner e g analysis concepts explicitly convey relevant information implicitly linked concepts Open source software tools well range free paid sentiment analysis tools deploy machine learning statistics natural language processing techniques automate sentiment analysis large collections texts including web pages online news internet discussion groups online reviews web blogs social media
Knowledge based systems hand make use publicly available resources extract semantic affective information associated natural language concepts
Sentiment analysis also performed visual content e images videos see Multimodal sentiment analysis
One first approaches direction SentiBank utilizing adjective noun pair representation visual content
In addition vast majority sentiment classification approaches rely bag words model disregards context grammar even word order
Approaches analyses sentiment based words compose meaning longer phrases shown better result incur additional annotation overhead
A human analysis component required sentiment analysis automated systems able analyze historical tendencies individual commenter platform often classified incorrectly expressed sentiment
Automation impacts approximately comments correctly classified humans
However humans often disagree argued inter human agreement provides upper bound automated sentiment classifiers eventually reach Sometimes structure sentiments topics fairly complex
Also problem sentiment analysis non monotonic respect sentence extension stop word substitution compare THEY would let dog stay hotel vs I would let dog stay hotel
To address issue number rule based reasoning based approaches applied sentiment analysis including defeasible logic programming
Also number tree traversal rules applied syntactic parse tree extract topicality sentiment open domain setting
Evaluation The accuracy sentiment analysis system principle well agrees human judgments
This usually measured variant measures based precision recall two target categories negative positive texts
However according research human raters typically agree time see Inter rater reliability
Thus program achieves accuracy classifying sentiment nearly well humans even though accuracy may sound impressive
If program right time humans would still disagree time since disagree much answer

Application recommender systems For recommender system sentiment analysis proven valuable technique
A recommender system aims predict preference item target user
Mainstream recommender systems work explicit data set
For example collaborative filtering works rating matrix content based filtering works meta data items
In many social networking services e commerce websites users provide text review comment feedback items
These user generated text provide rich source user sentiment opinions numerous products items
Potentially item text reveal related feature aspects item users sentiments feature
The item feature aspects described text play role meta data content based filtering former valuable recommender system
Since features broadly mentioned users reviews seen crucial features significantly influence user experience item meta data item usually provided producers instead consumers may ignore features concerned users
For different items common features user may give different sentiments
Also feature item may receive different sentiments different users
Users sentiments features regarded multi dimensional rating score reflecting preference items
Based feature aspects sentiments extracted user generated text hybrid recommender system constructed
There two types motivation recommend candidate item user
The first motivation candidate item numerous common features user preferred items second motivation candidate item receives high sentiment features
For preferred item reasonable believe items features similar function utility
So items also likely preferred user
On hand shared feature two candidate items users may give positive sentiment one giving negative sentiment another
Clearly high evaluated item recommended user
Based two motivations combination ranking score similarity sentiment rating constructed candidate item Except difficulty sentiment analysis applying sentiment analysis reviews feedback also faces challenge spam biased reviews
One direction work focused evaluating helpfulness review
Review feedback poorly written hardly helpful recommender system
Besides review designed hinder sales target product thus harmful recommender system even well written
Researchers also found long short forms user generated text treated differently
An interesting result shows short form reviews sometimes helpful long form easier filter noise short form text
For long form text growing length text always bring proportionate increase number features sentiments text

Batch normalization technique improving speed performance stability artificial neural networks
Batch normalization introduced paper
It used normalize input layer adjusting scaling activations While effect batch normalization evident reasons behind effectiveness remain discussion
It believed mitigate problem internal covariate shift parameter initialization changes distribution inputs layer affects learning rate network
Recently scholars shown batch normalization reduce internal covariate shift rather smooths objective function improve performance
Others prove batch normalization achieves length direction decoupling thereby accelerates neural networks
Motivation Batch normalization initially proposed solve internal covariate shift
During training stage networks parameters preceding layers change distribution inputs current layer changes accordingly current layer needs constantly readjust new distributions
This problem especially severe deep networks small changes shallower hidden layers amplified propagate within network resulting significant shift deeper hidden layers
Therefore method batch normalization proposed reduce unwanted shifts speed training produce reliable models
Besides reducing internal covariate shift batch normalization introduces many benefits
With additional layer network use higher learning rate without vanishing exploding gradients
Furthermore batch normalization regularizes network easier generalize thus unnecessary use dropout mitigate overfitting
The network also becomes robust different initialization schemes learning rates
Procedures Batch Normalizing Transform In neural network batch normalization achieved normalization step fixes means variances layer inputs
Ideally normalization would conducted entire training set use step jointly stochastic optimization methods impractical use global information
Thus normalization restrained mini batch training process
Use B denote mini batch size entire training set
The mean variance B could thus denoted μ B x displaystyle mu _ B frac sum _ x_ σ B x μ B displaystyle sigma _ B frac sum _ x_ mu _ B
For layer network dimensional input x x


x displaystyle x x x dimension input normalized separately x k x k μ B k σ B k ϵ displaystyle hat x _ k frac x_ k mu _ B k sqrt sigma _ B k epsilon k displaystyle k displaystyle μ B k displaystyle mu _ B k σ B k displaystyle sigma _ B k per dimension mean variance respectively
ϵ displaystyle epsilon added denominator numerical stability arbitrarily small constant
The resulting normalized activation x k displaystyle hat x k zero mean unit variance ϵ displaystyle epsilon taken account
To restore representation power network transformation step follows k γ k x k β k displaystyle y_ k gamma k hat x _ k beta k parameters γ k displaystyle gamma k β k displaystyle beta k subsequently learnt optimization process
Formally transform B N γ k β k x k k displaystyle BN_ gamma k beta k x_ k rightarrow y_ k denoted Batch Normalizing Transform
The output BN transform k B N γ k β k x k displaystyle k BN_ gamma k beta k x k passed network layers normalized output x k displaystyle hat x _ k remains internal current layer
Backpropagation The described BN transform differentiable operation gradient loss l respect different parameters computed directly chain rule
Specifically l k displaystyle frac partial l partial y_ k depends choice activation function gradient parameters could expressed function l k displaystyle frac partial l partial y_ k l x k l k γ k displaystyle frac partial l partial hat x _ k frac partial l partial y_ k gamma k l γ k l k x k displaystyle frac partial l partial gamma k sum _ frac partial l partial y_ k hat x _ k l β k l k displaystyle frac partial l partial beta k sum _ frac partial l partial y_ k l σ B k l k x k μ B k γ k σ B k ϵ displaystyle frac partial l partial sigma _ B k sum _ frac partial l partial y_ k x_ k mu _ B k left frac gamma k sigma _ B k epsilon right l μ B k l k γ σ B k ϵ l σ B k x k μ B k displaystyle frac partial l partial mu _ B k sum _ frac partial l partial y_ k frac gamma sqrt sigma _ B k epsilon frac partial l partial sigma _ B k frac sum _ cdot x_ k mu _ B k l x k l x k σ B k l σ B k x k μ B k l μ B k displaystyle frac partial l partial x_ k frac partial l partial hat x _ k frac sqrt sigma _ B k frac partial l partial sigma _ B k frac x_ k mu _ B k frac partial l partial mu _ B k frac
Inference Batch Normalized Networks During training stage normalization steps depend mini batches ensure efficient reliable training
However inference stage dependence useful
Instead normalization step stage computed population statistics output could depend input deterministic manner
The population mean E x k displaystyle E x k variance V r x k displaystyle Var x k computed E x k E B μ B k displaystyle E x k E_ B mu _ B k V r x k E B σ B k displaystyle Var x k frac E_ B sigma _ B k
The population statistics thus complete representation mini batches
The BN transform inference step thus becomes k B N γ k β k n f x k γ V r x k ϵ x k β γ E x k V r x k ϵ displaystyle k BN_ gamma k beta k inf x k frac gamma sqrt Var x k epsilon x k Bigg beta frac gamma E x k sqrt Var x k epsilon Bigg k displaystyle k passed future layers instead x k displaystyle x k
Since parameters fixed transformation batch normalization procedure essentially applying linear transform activation
Understanding Batch Normalization Although batch normalization become popular method due strengths working mechanism method yet well understood
Scholars show internal covariate shift reduced significantly batch normalization despite common belief
Some scholars attribute good performance smoothing objective function others propose length direction decoupling reason behind effectiveness
Batch Normalization Internal Covariate Shift The correlation batch normalization internal covariate shift widely accepted supported experimental results
Scholars recently show experiments hypothesized relationship accurate one
Rather enhanced accuracy batch normalization layer seems independent internal covariate shift
Adding Covariate Shift Batch Normalization Layers To understand correlation reducing covariate shift improving performance experiment performed elucidate relationship
Specifically three models trained compared standard VGG network without batch normalization VGG network batch normalization layers VGG network batch normalization layers random noise
In third model noise non zero mean non unit variance generated random layer
It added batch normalization layers deliberately introduce covariate shift activation
With three models two observations made
First third noisy model less stable distributions layers compared two models due extra noise layer
Despite noise training accuracy second third model similar higher first model
While internal covariate shifts larger levels model batch normalization still performs better standard VGG model
It could thus concluded internal covariate shift might contributing factor performance batch normalization
Measuring Internal Covariate Shift without Batch Normalization Layers Since hypothesized batch normalization layers could reduce internal covariate shift experiment set measure quantitatively much covariate shift reduced
First notion internal covariate shift needs defined mathematically
Specifically quantify adjustment layer parameters make response updates previous layers correlation gradients loss previous layers updated measured since gradients could capture shifts first order training method
If shift introduced changes previous layers small correlation gradients would close
The correlation gradients computed four models standard VGG network VGG network batch normalization layers layer deep linear network DLN trained full batch gradient descent DLN network batch normalization layers
Interestingly shown standard VGG DLN models higher correlations gradients compared counterparts indicating additional batch normalization layers reducing internal covariate shift
Smoothness Optimization Landscape Some scholars proposed proved batch normalization could introduce greater Lipschitzness loss gradient training improved smoothness could explain great performance
These effects observed comparing VGG networks trained without batch normalization also consistent among networks linear deep networks
Specifically observed loss changes less gradients loss smaller magnitudes Lipschitz
Moreover batch normalized models compared models different normalization techniques
Specifically normalization methods work first fixing first order moment activation normalizing average l p displaystyle l_ p norm
These methods thus larger distributional shift smoother landscape
Evidently models yield similar performance batch normalized models
This two way relationship could thus indicate smoothness optimization landscape could contributing factor superior performance batch normalization
Besides analyzing correlation experimentally theoretical analysis also provided verification batch normalization could result smoother landscape
Consider two identical networks one contains batch normalization layers behaviors two networks compared
Denote loss functions L displaystyle L L displaystyle hat L respectively
Let input networks x displaystyle x output displaystyle W x displaystyle Wx W displaystyle W layer weights
For second network displaystyle additionally goes batch normalization layer
Denote normalized activation displaystyle hat zero mean unit variance
Let transformed activation z γ β displaystyle z gamma hat beta suppose γ displaystyle gamma β displaystyle beta constants
Finally denote standard deviation mini batch j R displaystyle hat y_ j mathbb R σ j displaystyle sigma _ j
First shown gradient magnitude batch normalized network L displaystyle triangledown _ y_ hat L bounded bound expressed L γ σ j L L L j displaystyle triangledown _ y_ hat L leq frac gamma sigma _ j Bigg triangledown _ y_ L frac langle triangledown _ y_ L rangle frac langle triangledown _ y_ L hat _ j rangle bigg
Since gradient magnitude represents Lipschitzness loss relationship indicates batch normalized network could achieve greater Lipschitzness comparatively
Notice bound gets tighter gradient L displaystyle triangledown _ y_ hat L correlates activation displaystyle hat y_ common phenomena
The scaling γ σ j displaystyle frac gamma sigma _ j also significant since variance often large
Secondly quadratic form loss Hessian respect activation gradient direction bounded j L T L j j j L γ σ L j T L j j L j γ σ j L j L j displaystyle triangledown _ y_ j hat L T frac partial hat L partial y_ j partial y_ j triangledown _ y_ j hat L leq frac gamma sigma bigg frac partial hat L partial y_ j bigg T bigg frac partial L partial y_ j partial y_ j bigg bigg frac partial hat L partial y_ j bigg frac gamma sigma langle triangledown _ y_ j L hat y_ j rangle bigg bigg frac partial hat L partial y_ j bigg bigg
The scaling γ σ j displaystyle frac gamma sigma _ j indicates loss Hessian resilient mini batch variance whereas second term right hand side suggests becomes smoother Hessian inner product non negative
If loss locally convex Hessian positive semi definite inner product positive g j displaystyle hat g_ j direction towards minimum loss
It could thus concluded inequality gradient generally becomes predictive batch normalization layer
It follows translate bounds related loss respect normalized activation bound loss respect network weights g j γ σ j g j μ g j λ j L j displaystyle hat g_ j leq frac gamma sigma _ j g_ j mu _ g_ j lambda langle triangledown _ y_ j L hat _ j rangle g j x X λ W L displaystyle g_ j max_ X leq lambda triangledown _ W L g j x X λ W L displaystyle hat g _ j max_ X leq lambda triangledown _ W hat L
In addition smoother landscape shown batch normalization could result better initialization following inequality W W W W W W W W displaystyle W_ hat W leq W_ W frac W W langle W W_ rangle W displaystyle W W displaystyle hat W local optimal weights two networks respectively
Some scholars argue analysis cannot fully capture performance batch normalization proof concerns largest eigenvalue equivalently one direction landscape points
It suggested complete eigenspectrum needs taken account make conclusive analysis
Length Direction Decoupling It argued success batch normalization could least partially credited length direction decoupling effect method provides
By interpreting batch normalization procedure reparametrization weight space could shown length direction weights separated procedure could thus trained separately
For particular neural network unit input x displaystyle x weight vector w displaystyle w denote output f w E x ϕ x T w displaystyle f w E_ x phi x T w ϕ displaystyle phi activation function denote S E x x T displaystyle S E xx T
Assume E x displaystyle E x spectrum matrix S displaystyle S bounded μ λ n S displaystyle mu lambda _ min S L λ x S displaystyle L lambda _ max S infty S displaystyle S symmetric positive definite
Adding batch normalization unit thus results f B N w γ β E x ϕ B N x T w E x ϕ γ x T w E x x T w v r x x T w β displaystyle f_ BN w gamma beta E_ x phi BN x T w E_ x bigg phi bigg gamma frac x T w E_ x x T w var_ x x T w beta bigg bigg definition
The variance term simplified v r x x T w w T S w displaystyle var_ x x T w w T Sw
Assume x displaystyle x zero mean β displaystyle beta omitted follows f B N w γ E x ϕ γ x T w w T S w displaystyle f_ BN w gamma E_ x bigg phi bigg gamma frac x T w w T Sw bigg bigg w T S w displaystyle w T Sw frac induced norm S displaystyle S w displaystyle w _
Hence could concluded f B N w γ E x ϕ x T w displaystyle f_ BN w gamma E_ x phi x T tilde w w γ w w displaystyle tilde w gamma frac w w _ γ displaystyle gamma w displaystyle w accounts length direction separately
This property could used prove faster convergence problems batch normalization
Linear Convergence Least Square Problem Batch Normalization With reparametrization interpretation could proved applying batch normalization ordinary least squares problem achieves linear convergence rate gradient descent faster regular gradient descent sub linear convergence
Denote objective minimizing ordinary lest squares problem n w R f O L S w n w R E x x T w n w R u T w w T S w displaystyle min_ tilde w R f_ OLS tilde w min_ tilde w R E_ x x T tilde w min_ tilde w R u T tilde w tilde w T S tilde w u E x displaystyle u E yx
Since w γ w w displaystyle tilde w gamma frac w w _ objective thus becomes n w R γ R f O L S w γ n w R γ R γ u T w w S γ displaystyle min_ w R backslash gamma R f_ OLS w gamma min_ w R backslash gamma R bigg gamma frac u T w w _ S gamma bigg excluded avoid denominator
Since objective convex respect γ displaystyle gamma optimal value could calculated setting partial derivative objective γ displaystyle gamma
The objective could simplified n w R ρ w n w R w T u u T w w T S w displaystyle min_ w R backslash rho w min_ w R backslash bigg frac w T uu T w w T Sw bigg
Note objective form generalized Rayleigh quotient ρ w w T B w w T A w displaystyle tilde rho w frac w T Bw w T Aw B R displaystyle B R times symmetric matrix A R displaystyle A R times symmetric positive definite matrix

By setting gradient thus follows bounded critical points w displaystyle tilde w _ expressed w g S u displaystyle tilde w _ g_ S u g displaystyle g_ depends w displaystyle tilde w _ ϕ displaystyle phi
Combining global property length direction decoupling could thus proved optimization problem converges linearly

The cerebellar model arithmetic computer CMAC type neural network based model mammalian cerebellum
It also known cerebellar model articulation controller
It type associative memory The CMAC first proposed function modeler robotic controllers James Albus hence name extensively used reinforcement learning also automated classification machine learning community
CMAC computes function f x


x n displaystyle f x_ x_ n n displaystyle n number input dimensions
The input space divided hyper rectangles associated memory cell
The contents memory cells weights adjusted training
Usually one quantisation input space used point input space associated number hyper rectangles therefore number memory cells
The output CMAC algebraic sum weights memory cells activated input point
A change value input point results change set activated hyper rectangles therefore change set memory cells participating CMAC output
The CMAC output therefore stored distributed fashion output corresponding point input space derived value stored number memory cells hence name associative memory
This provides generalisation
Building blocks In adjacent image two inputs CMAC represented D space
Two quantising functions used divide space two overlapping grids one shown heavier lines
A single input shown near middle activated two memory cells corresponding shaded area
If another point occurs close one shown share memory cells providing generalisation
The CMAC trained presenting pairs input points output values adjusting weights activated cells proportion error observed output
This simple training algorithm proof convergence It normal add kernel function hyper rectangle points falling towards edge hyper rectangle smaller activation falling near centre One major problems cited practical use CMAC memory size required directly related number cells used
This usually ameliorated using hash function providing memory storage actual cells activated inputs
One step convergent algorithm Initially least mean square LMS method employed update weights CMAC
The convergence using LMS training CMAC sensitive learning rate could lead divergence
In recursive least squares RLS algorithm introduced train CMAC online
It need tune learning rate
Its convergence proved theoretically guaranteed converge one step
The computational complexity RLS algorithm O N
Hardware implementation infrastructure Based QR decomposition algorithm QRLS simplified O N complexity
Consequently reduces memory usage time cost significantly
A parallel pipeline array structure implementing algorithm introduced Overall utilizing QRLS algorithm CMAC neural network convergence guaranteed weights nodes updated using one step training
Its parallel pipeline array structure offers great potential implemented hardware large scale industry usage
Continuous CMAC Since rectangular shape CMAC receptive field functions produce discontinuous staircase function approximation integrating CMAC B splines functions continuous CMAC offers capability obtaining order derivatives approximate functions
Deep CMAC In recent years numerous studies confirmed stacking several shallow structures single deep structure overall system could achieve better data representation thus effectively deal nonlinear high complexity tasks
In deep CMAC DCMAC framework proposed backpropagation algorithm derived estimate DCMAC parameters
Experimental results adaptive noise cancellation task showed proposed DCMAC achieve better noise cancellation performance compared conventional single layer CMAC

In aesthetics uncanny valley hypothesized relationship degree object resemblance human emotional response object
The concept uncanny valley suggests humanoid objects imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke uncanny strangely familiar feelings eeriness revulsion observers
Valley denotes dip human observer affinity replica relation otherwise increases replica human likeness Examples found robotics D computer animations lifelike dolls among others
With increasing prevalence virtual reality augmented reality photorealistic computer animation valley cited popular press reaction verisimilitude creation approaches indistinguishability reality
The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts entity appearing almost human risk eliciting cold eerie feelings viewers
Etymology The concept identified robotics professor Masahiro Mori bukimi tani genshō 不気味の谷現象
The term first translated uncanny valley book Robots Fact Fiction Prediction written Jasia Reichardt thus forging unintended link Ernst Jentsch concept uncanny introduced essay entitled On Psychology Uncanny
Jentsch conception elaborated Sigmund Freud essay entitled The Uncanny Das Unheimliche
Hypothesis Mori original hypothesis states appearance robot made human observers emotional response robot becomes increasingly positive empathetic reaches point beyond response quickly becomes strong revulsion
However robot appearance continues become less distinguishable human emotional response becomes positive approaches human human empathy levels This area repulsive response aroused robot appearance motion barely human fully human entity uncanny valley
The name captures idea almost human looking robot seems overly strange human beings produces feeling uncanniness thus fails evoke empathic response required productive human robot interaction
Theoretical basis A number theories proposed explain cognitive mechanism underlying phenomenon Mate selection
Automatic stimulus driven appraisals uncanny stimuli elicit aversion activating evolved cognitive mechanism avoidance selecting mates low fertility poor hormonal health ineffective immune systems based visible features face body predictive traits
Mortality salience
Viewing uncanny robot elicits innate fear death culturally supported defenses coping death inevitability P artially disassembled androids play subconscious fears reduction replacement annihilation A mechanism human façade mechanical interior plays subconscious fear soulless machines
Androids various states mutilation decapitation disassembly reminiscent battlefield conflict serve reminder mortality
Since androids copies actual people doppelgängers may elicit fear replaced job relationship
The jerkiness android movements could unsettling elicits fear losing bodily control
Pathogen avoidance
Uncanny stimuli may activate cognitive mechanism originally evolved motivate avoidance potential sources pathogens eliciting disgust response
The human organism looks stronger aversion defects defects indicate disease human looking organisms closely related human beings genetically probability contracting disease causing bacteria viruses parasites increases genetic similarity
The visual anomalies androids robots animated human characters cause reactions alarm revulsion similar corpses visibly diseased individuals
Sorites paradoxes
Stimuli human nonhuman traits undermine sense human identity linking qualitatively different categories human nonhuman quantitative metric degree human likeness
Violation human norms
The uncanny valley may symptomatic entities elicit model human measure
If entity looks sufficiently nonhuman human characteristics noticeable generating empathy
However entity looks almost human elicits model human detailed normative expectations
The nonhuman characteristics noticeable giving human viewer sense strangeness
In words robot stuck inside uncanny valley longer judged standards robot passable job pretending human instead judged standards human terrible job acting like normal person
This linked perceptual uncertainty theory predictive coding
Religious definition human identity
The existence artificial humanlike entities viewed threat concept human identity
An example found theoretical framework psychiatrist Irvin Yalom
Yalom explains humans construct psychological defenses order avoid existential anxiety stemming death
One defenses specialness irrational belief aging death central premises life apply others oneself
The experience humanlike living robot rich compelling challenges humans notions specialness existential defenses eliciting existential anxiety
In folklore creation human like soulless beings often shown unwise golem Judaism whose absence human empathy spirit lead disaster however good intentions creator
Conflicting perceptual cues
The negative effect associated uncanny stimuli produced activation conflicting cognitive representations
Perceptual tension occurs individual perceives conflicting cues category membership humanoid figure moves like robot visible robot features
This cognitive conflict experienced psychological discomfort e eeriness much like discomfort experienced cognitive dissonance
Several studies support possibility
Mathur Reichling found time subjects took gauge robot face human mechanical resemblance peaked faces deepest uncanny valley suggesting perceptually classifying faces human robot posed greater cognitive challenge
However found perceptual confusion coincided uncanny valley mediate effect uncanny valley subjects social emotional reactions suggesting perceptual confusion may mechanism behind uncanny valley effect
Burleigh colleagues demonstrated faces midpoint human non human stimuli produced level reported eeriness diverged otherwise linear model relating human likeness affect
Yamada et al
found cognitive difficulty associated negative affect midpoint morphed continuum e g series stimuli morphing cartoon dog real dog
Ferrey et al
demonstrated midpoint images continuum anchored two stimulus categories produced maximum negative affect found human non human entities
Schoenherr Burleigh provide examples history culture evidence aversion hybrid entities aversion genetically modified organisms Frankenfoods
Finally Moore developed Bayesian mathematical model provides quantitative account perceptual conflict
There debate precise mechanisms responsible
It argued effect driven categorization difficulty perceptual mismatch frequency based sensitization inhibitory devaluation
Threat humans distinctiveness identity
Negative reactions toward humanlike robots related challenge kind robot leads categorical human non human distinction
Kaplan stated new machines challenge human uniqueness pushing redefinition humanness
MacDorman Entenzari investigated distinction human robots individual trait predict sensitivity uncanny valley phenomenon
Ferrari Paladino Jetten found increase anthropomorphic appearance robot leads enhancement threat human distinctiveness identity
The robot resembles real person represents challenge social identity human beings
Research A series studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist static images robot faces
Mathur MB Reichling DB used two complementary sets stimuli spanning range mechanical human like first sample objectively chosen robot face images Internet searches second morphometrically graphically controlled face series set faces
They asked subjects explicitly rate likability face
To measure trust toward face subjects completed one shot investment game indirectly measure much money willing wager robot trustworthiness
Both stimulus sets showed robust uncanny valley effect explicitly rated likability context dependent uncanny valley implicitly rated trust
Their exploratory analysis one proposed mechanism uncanny valley perceptual confusion category boundary found category confusion occurs uncanny valley mediate effect social emotional responses
One study conducted examined evolutionary mechanism behind aversion associated uncanny valley
A group five monkeys shown three images two different D monkey faces realistic unrealistic real photo monkey face
The monkeys eye gaze used proxy preference aversion
Since realistic D monkey face looked less either real photo unrealistic D monkey face interpreted indication monkey participants found realistic D face aversive otherwise preferred two images
As one would expect uncanny valley realism lead less positive reactions study demonstrated neither human specific cognitive processes human culture explain uncanny valley
In words aversive reaction realism said evolutionary origin As researchers University California San Diego California Institute Telecommunications Information Technology measuring human brain activations related uncanny valley
In one study using fMRI group cognitive scientists roboticists found biggest differences brain responses uncanny robots parietal cortex sides brain specifically areas connect part brain visual cortex processes bodily movements section motor cortex thought contain mirror neurons
The researchers say saw essence evidence mismatch perceptual conflict
The brain lit human like appearance android robotic motion compute
Ayşe Pınar Saygın assistant professor UCSD says The brain seem selectively tuned either biological appearance biological motion per se
What seems looking expectations met appearance motion congruent
Viewer perception facial expression speech uncanny valley realistic human like characters intended video games film investigated Tinwell et al
Consideration also given Tinwell et al
uncanny may exaggerated antipathetic characters survival horror games
Building body work already undertaken android science research intends build conceptual framework uncanny valley using D characters generated real time gaming engine
The goal analyze cross modal factors facial expression speech exaggerate uncanny
Tinwell et al also introduced notion unscalable uncanny wall suggests viewer discernment detecting imperfections realism keep pace new technologies simulating realism
A summary Angela Tinwell research uncanny valley psychological reasons behind uncanny valley designers may overcome uncanny human like virtual characters provided book The Uncanny Valley Games Animation CRC Press
Design principles A number design principles proposed avoiding uncanny valley Design elements match human realism
A robot may look uncanny human nonhuman elements mixed
For example robot synthetic voice human human voice found less eerie robot human voice human synthetic voice
For robot give positive impression degree human realism appearance also match degree human realism behavior
If animated character looks human movement gives negative impression
Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance motion kinematics important
Reducing conflict uncertainty matching appearance behavior ability
In terms performance robot looks appliance like people expect little looks human people expect much
A highly human like appearance leads expectation certain behaviors present humanlike motion dynamics
This likely operates sub conscious level may biological basis
Neuroscientists noted brain expectations met brain generates prediction error
As human like artificial agents become commonplace perhaps perceptual systems tuned accommodate new social partners
Or perhaps decide good idea make robots clearly image
Human facial proportions photorealistic texture used together
A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions computer generated character fall uncanny valley
Abnormal facial proportions including typically used artists enhance attractiveness e g larger eyes look eerie photorealistic human texture
Avoiding photorealistic texture permit leeway
Criticism A number criticisms raised concerning whether uncanny valley exists unified phenomenon amenable scientific scrutiny Good design lift human looking entities valley
David Hanson criticized Mori hypothesis entities approaching human appearance necessarily evaluated negatively
He shown uncanny valley Karl MacDorman Hiroshi Ishiguro generated participants rate photographs morphed humanoid robots android robots human beings could flattened adding neotenous cartoonish features entities formerly fallen valley
This approach uses fact humans find characteristics appealing reminiscent young well many species used cartoons
The uncanny appears degree human likeness
Hanson also pointed uncanny entities may appear anywhere spectrum ranging abstract e g MIT robot Lazlo perfectly human e g cosmetically atypical people
Capgras delusion relatively rare condition sufferer believes people cases things replaced duplicates
These duplicates rationally accepted identical physical properties irrational belief held true entity replaced something else
Some sufferers Capgras delusion claim duplicate robot
Ellis Lewis argue delusion arises intact system overt recognition coupled damaged system covert recognition leads conflict individual identifiable familiar emotional sense
This supports view uncanny valley could arise due issues categorical perception particular way brain processes information
The uncanny valley heterogeneous group phenomena
Phenomena labeled uncanny valley diverse involve different sense modalities multiple possibly overlapping causes range evolved learned circuits early face perception culturally shared psychological constructs
People cultural backgrounds may considerable influence androids perceived respect uncanny valley
The uncanny valley may generational
Younger generations used CGI robots may less likely affected hypothesized issue
Similar effects An effect similar uncanny valley noted Charles Darwin The expression Trigonocephalus snake face hideous fierce pupil consisted vertical slit mottled coppery iris jaws broad base nose terminated triangular projection
I think I ever saw anything ugly excepting perhaps vampire bats
I imagine repulsive aspect originates features placed positions respect somewhat proportional human face thus obtain scale hideousness
A similar uncanny valley effect could according ethical futurist writer Jamais Cascio show humans begin modifying transhuman enhancements cf
body modification aim improve abilities human body beyond would normally possible eyesight muscle strength cognition
So long enhancements remain within perceived norm human behavior negative reaction unlikely individuals supplant normal human variety revulsion expected
However according theory technologies gain distance human norms transhuman individuals would cease judged human levels instead regarded separate entities altogether point dubbed posthuman acceptance would rise uncanny valley
Another example comes pageant retouching photos especially children find disturbingly doll like Due rapid advancements areas artificial intelligence affective computing cognitive scientists also suggested possibility Uncanny Valley Mind
Accordingly people might experience strong feelings aversion encounter highly advanced emotion sensitive technology
Among possible explanations phenomenon perceived loss human uniqueness expectations immediate physical harm discussed contemporary research
In visual effects A number films use computer generated imagery show characters described reviewers giving feeling revulsion creepiness result characters looking realistic
Examples include following According roboticist Dario Floreano baby character Billy Pixar groundbreaking animated short film Tin Toy provoked negative audience reactions first led film industry take concept uncanny valley seriously
The film Final Fantasy The Spirits Within first photorealistic computer animated feature film provoked negative reactions viewers due near realistic yet imperfect visual depictions human characters
The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw stated film animation brilliant solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely almost quite
Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers wrote film At first fun watch characters But notice coldness eyes mechanical quality movements
Several reviewers animated film The Polar Express called animation eerie
CNN com reviewer Paul Clinton wrote Those human characters film come across downright well creepy
So The Polar Express best disconcerting worst wee bit horrifying
The term eerie used reviewers Kurt Loder Manohla Dargis among others
Newsday reviewer John Anderson called film characters creepy dead eyed wrote The Polar Express zombie train
Animation director Ward Jenkins wrote online analysis describing changes Polar Express characters appearance especially eyes eyebrows could avoided considered feeling deadness faces
In review animated film Beowulf New York Times technology writer David Gallagher wrote film failed uncanny valley test stating film villain monster Grendel slightly scarier closeups hero Beowulf face allowing viewers admire every hair D digital stubble
Some reviewers animated film A Christmas Carol criticized animation creepy
Joe Neumaier New York Daily News said film The motion capture favors co stars Gary Oldman Colin Firth Robin Wright Penn since Polar Express animated eyes never seem focus
And photorealism characters get wiggly limbed bouncy standard Disney cartoons putting
Mary Elizabeth Williams Salon com wrote film In center action Jim Carrey least dead eyed doll like version Carrey
In live action film The Last Airbender character Appa flying bison called uncanny
Geekosystem Susana Polo found character really quite creepy noting prey animals like bison eyes sides heads moving front without changing rest facial structure tips us right uncanny valley
The animated film Mars Needs Moms widely criticized creepy unnatural style animation
The film among biggest box office bombs history may due part audience revulsion
Mars Needs Moms produced Robert Zemeckis production company ImageMovers previously produced The Polar Express Beowulf A Christmas Carol
Reviewers mixed opinions regarding whether animated film The Adventures Tintin The Secret Unicorn affected uncanny valley
Daniel D Snyder The Atlantic wrote Instead trying bring life Herge beautiful artwork Spielberg co opted bring movie D era using trendy motion capture technique recreate Tintin friends
Tintin original face barebones never suffered lack expression
It outfitted alien unfamiliar visage plastic skin dotted pores subtle wrinkles
He added In bringing life Spielberg made characters dead
N B
The Economist called elements animation grotesque writing Tintin Captain Haddock others exist settings almost photo realistic nearly features flesh blood people
And yet still sausage fingers distended noses comic strip characters
It much The Secret Unicorn The Invasion Body Snatchers
However reviewers felt film avoided uncanny valley despite animated characters realism
Critic Dana Stevens Slate wrote With possible exception title character animated cast Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment called uncanny valley
Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly wrote film passed beyond uncanny valley plains hyperreality
The film The Lion King remake film featured photo realistic digital animals place earlier film traditional animation divided critics effectiveness imagery
Ann Hornaday The Washington Post wrote images realistic might best remembered summer left Uncanny Valley good
However critics felt realism animals setting rendered scenes characters sing dance disturbing weird
The film Sonic Hedgehog delayed November release date extremely negative audience reaction title character design first trailer forced creators redesign
Multiple commentators cited CGI half human half cat characters movie Cats example uncanny valley effect first release trailer film film actual release
Virtual actors An increasingly common practice feature virtual actors films CGI likenesses real actors used original actor either looks old part deceased
Sometimes virtual actor created involvement original actor may contribute motion capture audio etc
times actor involvement
Reviewers often criticized use virtual actors uncanny valley effect saying adds eerie feeling movie
Examples virtual actors received criticism include replicas Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator Salvation Jeff Bridges Tron Legacy Schwarzenegger Terminator Genisys Peter Cushing Carrie Fisher Rogue One
Will Smith Gemini Man The use virtual actors contrast digital de aging involve simply removing wrinkles actors faces
This practice generally faced uncanny valley criticism
One exception film The Irishman Robert De Niro Al Pacino Joe Pesci de aged try make look years younger one reviewer wrote actors hunched stiff body language stood marked contrast facial appearance another wrote De Niro character looked like Deepfake software first began widely used uses machine learning graft one person appearance onto another facial expressions thus providing alternate approach creating virtual actors digital de aging
Various individuals created web videos use deepfake software create notable previous uses virtual actors de aging film
Journalists tended praise deepfake imitations calling naturalistic objectively better originals
In fiction In Rock episode Succession Frank Rossitano explains uncanny valley concept using graph Star Wars examples try convince Tracy Jordan dream creating pornographic video game impossible
He also references computer animated film The Polar Express

The Loebner Prize annual competition artificial intelligence awards prizes computer programs considered judges human like
The format competition standard Turing test
In round human judge simultaneously holds textual conversations computer program human via computer
Based upon responses judge must decide
The contest launched Hugh Loebner conjunction Cambridge Center Behavioral Studies Massachusetts United States
Since organised AISB Bletchley Park
It also associated Flinders University Dartmouth College Science Museum London University Reading Ulster University Magee Campus Derry UK City Culture

The psychology reasoning study people reason often broadly defined process drawing conclusions inform people solve problems make decisions
It overlaps psychology philosophy linguistics cognitive science artificial intelligence logic probability theory
Psychological experiments humans animals reason carried years
An enduring question whether people capacity rational
What mean rational
Current research area addresses various questions reasoning rationality judgments intelligence relationships emotion reasoning development
Everyday reasoning How people reason sentences natural language
Most experimentation deduction carried hypothetical thought particular examining people reason conditionals e g If A B
Participants experiments make modus ponens inference given indicative conditional If A B given premise A conclude B
However given indicative conditional minor premise modus tollens inference B half participants experiments conclude A remainder concludes nothing follows The ease people make conditional inferences affected content demonstrated well known selection task developed Peter Wason
Participants better able test conditional contains sensible content e g envelope sealed must cent stamp compared one contains symbolic content e g letter vowel number even
Background knowledge also lead suppression even simple modus ponens inference Participants given conditional Lisa essay write studies late library premise Lisa essay write make modus ponens inference studies late library inference suppressed also given second conditional library stays open studies late library
Interpretations suppression effect controversial Other investigations propositional inference examine people think disjunctive alternatives e g A else B reason negation e g It case A B
Many experiments carried examine people make relational inferences including comparisons e g A better B
Such investigations also concern spatial inferences e g
A front B temporal inferences e g
A occurs B
Other common tasks include categorical syllogisms used examine people reason quantifiers All Some e g Some A B
Theories reasoning There several alternative theories cognitive processes human reasoning based
One view people rely mental logic consisting formal abstract syntactic inference rules similar developed logicians propositional calculus
Another view people rely domain specific content sensitive rules inference
A third view people rely mental models mental representations correspond imagined possibilities
The mental model theory subject mental models website
A fourth view people compute probabilities One controversial theoretical issue identification appropriate competence model standard compare human reasoning
Initially classical logic chosen competence model
Subsequently researchers opted non monotonic logic Bayesian probability
Research mental models reasoning led suggestion people rational principle err practice
Connectionist approaches towards reasoning also proposed
Development reasoning How reasoning develop
Jean Piaget theory cognitive development describes sequence stages development reasoning infancy adulthood
According neo Piagetian theories cognitive development changes reasoning development come increasing working memory capacity increasing speed processing enhanced executive functions control
Increasing self awareness also important factor
Different sorts reasoning Inductive reasoning makes broad generalizations specific cases observations
In process reasoning general assertions made based past specific pieces evidence
This kind reasoning allows conclusion false even original statement true
For example one observes college athlete one makes predictions assumptions college athletes based one observation
Scientists use inductive reasoning create theories hypotheses In opposition deductive reasoning basic form valid reasoning
In reasoning process person starts known claim general belief asks follows foundations premises influence beliefs
In words deduction starts hypothesis examines possibilities reach conclusion
Deduction helps people understand predictions wrong indicates prior knowledge beliefs track
An example deduction seen scientific method testing hypotheses theories
Although conclusion usually corresponds therefore proves hypothesis cases conclusion logical generalization
For example argument All young girls wear skirts
Julie young girl
Therefore Julie wears skirts valid logically sound first premise true
The syllogism form deductive reasoning two statements reach logical conclusion
With reasoning one statement could Every A B another could This C A
Those two statements could lead conclusion This C B
These types syllogisms used test deductive reasoning ensure valid hypothesis
A Syllogistic Reasoning Task created study performed Morsanyi Kinga Handley Simon examined intuitive contributions reasoning
They used test assess syllogistic reasoning performance based interplay conscious effortful evaluation logicality intuitive appreciation believability conclusions Another form reasoning called abductive reasoning
This type based creating testing hypotheses using best information available
Abductive reasoning produces kind daily decision making works best information present often incomplete
This could involve making educated guesses observed unexplainable phenomena
This type reasoning seen world doctors make decisions diagnoses set results jurors use relevant evidence make decisions case
Judgment reasoning Judgment reasoning involve thinking options making judgment conclusion finally making decision
Making judgments involves heuristics efficient strategies usually lead right answers
The common heuristics used attribute substitution availability heuristic representativeness heuristic anchoring heuristic aid quick reasoning work situations
Heuristics allow errors price paid gain efficiency Other errors judgment therefore affecting reasoning include errors judgment covariation relationship two variables presence magnitude one predict presence magnitude
One cause covariation confirmation bias tendency responsive evidence confirms beliefs
But assessing covariation pulled track neglecting base rate information frequently something occurs general
However people often ignore base rates tend use information presented
There sophisticated judgment strategies result fewer errors
People often reason based availability sometimes look accurate information make judgments
This suggests two ways thinking known Dual Process Model
The first System I fast automatic uses heuristics intuition
The second System II slower effortful likely correct reasoning
Pragmatics reasoning How various related factors linguistic pragmatics emotion relate inferences people draw Decision making often influenced emotion regret element risk
People strongly motivated regret see select options tend select option regret least trying minimize amount regret
Many decisions also include large element risk cases people tend ask level risk
They ask much dread would experience thinking nuclear accident use dread indicator risk
We ask make feel rather risky Antonio Damasio suggests somatic markers certain memories cause strong bodily reaction act way guide decision making well
For example remembering scary movie become tense palms might begin sweat
Damasio argues making decision rely gut feelings assess various options makes us decide go decision positive stay away negative
He also argues orbitofrontal cortex located base frontal lobe eyes crucial use somatic markers part brain allows interpret emotion
Another note make emotion shapes decisions influence usually based predictions future
When people ask would react making inferences future
Researchers suggest affective forecasting ability predict emotions poor people tend overestimate much regret errors
Neuroscience reasoning What neural correlates reasoning often investigated using event related potentials functional magnetic resonance imaging

While many transhumanist theorists advocates seek apply reason science technology purposes reducing poverty disease disability malnutrition around globe transhumanism distinctive particular focus applications technologies improvement human bodies individual level
Many transhumanists actively assess potential future technologies innovative social systems improve quality life seeking make material reality human condition fulfill promise legal political equality eliminating congenital mental physical barriers
Transhumanist philosophers argue exists perfectionist ethical imperative humans strive progress improvement human condition possible desirable humanity enter transhuman phase existence humans enhance beyond naturally human
In phase natural evolution would replaced deliberate participatory directed evolution
Some theorists Ray Kurzweil think pace technological innovation accelerating next years may yield radical technological advances possibly technological singularity may fundamentally change nature human beings
Transhumanists foresee massive technological change generally maintain desirable
However also concerned possible dangers extremely rapid technological change propose options ensuring advanced technology used responsibly
For example Bostrom written extensively existential risks humanity future welfare including ones could created emerging technologies While many people believe transhumanists striving immortality necessarily true
Hank Pellissier managing director Institute Ethics Emerging Technologies surveyed transhumanists
He found respondents want immortality
Some reasons argued boredom Earth overpopulation desire go afterlife
Empathic fallibility conversational consent Certain transhumanist philosophers hold since assumptions others experience fallible therefore attempts help protect beings capable correcting others assume matter well intentioned danger actually hurting sentient beings deserve sapient
These thinkers argue ability discuss falsification based way constitutes threshold arbitrary becomes possible individual speak way dependent exterior assumptions
They also argue beings capable experiencing something deserve elevated threshold typically stating underlying change leads threshold increase preciseness brain ability discriminate
This includes increasing neuron count connectivity animals well accelerating development connectivity order shorten ideally skip non sapient childhood incapable independently deciding oneself
Transhumanists description stress genetic engineering advocate general insertion somatic cells living beings germ cells purging individuals without modifications deeming latter unethical also unnecessary due possibilities efficient genetic engineering
Ethics Transhumanists engage interdisciplinary approaches understand evaluate possibilities overcoming biological limitations drawing futurology various fields ethics
Unlike many philosophers social critics activists place moral value preservation natural systems transhumanists see concept specifically natural problematically nebulous best obstacle progress worst

Singularitarianism moral ideology based upon belief technological singularity possible advocating deliberate action effect ensure safety
Technogaianism ecological ideology based upon belief emerging technologies help restore Earth environment developing safe clean alternative technology therefore important goal environmentalists
Spirituality Although many transhumanists atheists agnostics secular humanists religious spiritual views
Despite prevailing secular attitude transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused religions immortality several controversial new religious movements late th century explicitly embraced transhumanist goals transforming human condition applying technology alteration mind body Raëlism
However thinkers associated transhumanist movement focus practical goals using technology help achieve longer healthier lives speculating future understanding neurotheology application neurotechnology enable humans gain greater control altered states consciousness commonly interpreted spiritual experiences thus achieve profound self knowledge
Transhumanist Buddhists sought explore areas agreement various types Buddhism Buddhist derived meditation mind expanding neurotechnologies
However criticised appropriating mindfulness tool transcending humanness Some transhumanists believe compatibility human mind computer hardware theoretical implication human consciousness may someday transferred alternative media speculative technique commonly known mind uploading
One extreme formulation idea transhumanists interested proposal Omega Point Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler
Drawing upon ideas digitalism Tipler advanced notion collapse Universe billions years hence could create conditions perpetuation humanity simulated reality within megacomputer thus achieve form posthuman godhood
Before Tipler term Omega Point used Pierre Teilhard de Chardin paleontologist Jesuit theologian saw evolutionary telos development encompassing noosphere global consciousness Viewed perspective Christian thinkers idea mind uploading asserted represent denigration human body characteristic gnostic manichaean belief
Transhumanism presumed intellectual progenitors also described neo gnostic non Christian secular commentators The first dialogue transhumanism faith one day conference held University Toronto
Religious critics alone faulted philosophy transhumanism offering eternal truths relationship divine
They commented philosophy bereft beliefs leaves humanity adrift foggy sea postmodern cynicism anomie
Transhumanists responded criticisms reflect failure look actual content transhumanist philosophy far cynical rooted optimistic idealistic attitudes trace back Enlightenment
Following dialogue William Sims Bainbridge sociologist religion conducted pilot study published Journal Evolution Technology suggesting religious attitudes negatively correlated acceptance transhumanist ideas indicating individuals highly religious worldviews tended perceive transhumanism direct competitive though ultimately futile affront spiritual beliefs Since Mormon Transhumanist Association sponsors conferences lectures intersection technology religion
The Christian Transhumanist Association established

Prisco also recognizes importance spiritual ideas ones Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov origins transhumanism movement
Practice While transhumanists take abstract theoretical approach perceived benefits emerging technologies others offered specific proposals modifications human body including heritable ones
Transhumanists often concerned methods enhancing human nervous system

Technologies interest Transhumanists support emergence convergence technologies including nanotechnology biotechnology information technology cognitive science NBIC well hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality artificial intelligence superintelligence D bioprinting mind uploading chemical brain preservation cryonics
They believe humans use technologies become human
Therefore support recognition protection cognitive liberty morphological freedom procreative liberty civil liberties guarantee individuals choice using human enhancement technologies children
Some speculate human enhancement techniques emerging technologies may facilitate radical human enhancement later midpoint st century
Kurzweil book The Singularity Near Michio Kaku book Physics Future outline various human enhancement technologies give insight technologies may impact human race Some reports converging technologies NBIC concepts criticised transhumanist orientation alleged science fictional character

This first step towards hypothetically uploading contents human brain including memories emotions onto computer
Debate The notion prospect human enhancement related issues arouse public controversy
Criticisms transhumanism proposals take two main forms objecting likelihood transhumanist goals achieved practical criticisms objecting moral principles worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals underlying transhumanism ethical criticisms
Critics opponents often see transhumanists goals posing threats human values
Some widely known critiques transhumanist program novels fictional films
These works art despite presenting imagined worlds rather philosophical analyses used touchstones formal arguments
Various arguments made effect society adopts human enhancement technologies may come resemble dystopia depicted novel Brave New World Aldous Huxley On another front authors consider humanity already transhuman medical advances recent centuries significantly altered species
However conscious therefore transhumanistic way
From perspective transhumanism perpetually aspirational new technologies become mainstream adoption new yet unadopted technologies becomes new shifting goal
Feasibility In book sociologist Max Dublin pointed many past failed predictions technological progress argued modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate
He also objected saw scientism fanaticism nihilism advancing transhumanist causes
Dublin also said historical parallels existed Millenarian religions Communist doctrines Although generally sympathetic transhumanism public health professor Gregory Stock skeptical technical feasibility mass appeal cyborgization humanity predicted Raymond Kurzweil Hans Moravec Kevin Warwick
He said throughout st century many humans would find deeply integrated systems machines would remain biological
Primary changes form character would arise cyberware direct manipulation genetics metabolism biochemistry In book Science Salvation philosopher Mary Midgley traces notion achieving immortality transcendence material human body echoed transhumanist tenet mind uploading group male scientific thinkers early th century including J
B S Haldane members circle
She characterizes ideas quasi scientific dreams prophesies involving visions escape body coupled self indulgent uncontrolled power fantasies
Her argument focuses perceives pseudoscientific speculations irrational fear death driven fantasies thinkers disregard laymen remoteness eschatological visions Another critique aimed mainly algeny portmanteau alchemy genetics Jeremy Rifkin defined upgrading existing organisms design wholly new ones intent perfecting performance
It emphasizes issue biocomplexity unpredictability attempts guide development products biological evolution
This argument elaborated particular biologist Stuart Newman based recognition cloning germline genetic engineering animals error prone inherently disruptive embryonic development
Accordingly argued would create unacceptable risks use methods human embryos
Performing experiments particularly ones permanent biological consequences developing humans would thus violation accepted principles governing research human subjects see Declaration Helsinki
Moreover improvements experimental outcomes one species automatically transferable new species without experimentation claimed ethical route genetic manipulation humans early developmental stages As practical matter however international protocols human subject research may present legal obstacle attempts transhumanists others improve offspring germinal choice technology
According legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky existing laws would protect parents choose enhance child genome future liability arising adverse outcomes procedure Transhumanists supporters human genetic engineering dismiss practical concerns hand insofar high degree uncertainty timelines likely outcomes genetic modification experiments humans
However bioethicist James Hughes suggests one possible ethical route genetic manipulation humans early developmental stages building computer models human genome proteins specifies tissue engineering argues also codes
With exponential progress bioinformatics Hughes believes virtual model genetic expression human body far behind soon possible accelerate approval genetic modifications simulating effects virtual humans
Public health professor Gregory Stock points artificial chromosomes alleged safer alternative existing genetic engineering techniques Thinkers defend likelihood accelerating change point past pattern exponential increases humanity technological capacities
Kurzweil developed position book The Singularity Is Near
Intrinsic immorality It argued transhumanist thought humans attempt substitute God
The Vatican statement Communion Stewardship Human Persons Created Image God stated changing genetic identity man human person production infrahuman radically immoral implying man full right disposal biological nature
The statement also argues creation superhuman spiritually superior unthinkable since true improvement come religious experience realizing fully image God
Christian theologians lay activists several churches denominations expressed similar objections transhumanism claimed Christians attain afterlife radical transhumanism promises indefinite life extension abolition suffering
In view transhumanism another representative long line utopian movements seek create heaven earth
On hand religious thinkers allied transhumanist goals theologians Ronald Cole Turner Ted Peters hold doctrine co creation provides obligation use genetic engineering improve human biology Other critics target claim instrumental conception human body writings Marvin Minsky Hans Moravec transhumanists
Reflecting strain feminist criticism transhumanist program philosopher Susan Bordo points contemporary obsessions slenderness youth physical perfection sees affecting men women distinct ways logical extreme manifestations anxieties fantasies fostered culture
Some critics question social implications movement focus body modification
Political scientist Klaus Gerd Giesen particular asserted transhumanism concentration altering human body represents logical yet tragic consequence atomized individualism body commodification within consumer culture Nick Bostrom responds desire regain youth specifically transcend natural limitations human body general pan cultural pan historical therefore uniquely tied culture th century
He argues transhumanist program attempt channel desire scientific project par Human Genome Project achieve humanity oldest hope rather puerile fantasy social trend
Loss human identity In book Enough Staying Human Engineered Age environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued length many technologies postulated supported transhumanists including germinal choice technology nanomedicine life extension strategies
He claims would morally wrong humans tamper fundamental aspects children attempt overcome universal human limitations vulnerability aging maximum life span biological constraints physical cognitive ability
Attempts improve manipulation would remove limitations provide necessary context experience meaningful human choice
He claims human lives would longer seem meaningful world limitations could overcome technologically
Even goal using germinal choice technology clearly therapeutic purposes relinquished since would inevitably produce temptations tamper things cognitive capacities
He argues possible societies benefit renouncing particular technologies using examples Ming China Tokugawa Japan contemporary Amish Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin biologist Stuart Newman accept biotechnology power make profound changes organismal identity
They argue genetic engineering human beings fear blurring boundary human artifact
Philosopher Keekok Lee sees developments part accelerating trend modernization technology used transform natural artefactual
In extreme could lead manufacturing enslavement monsters human clones human animal chimeras bioroids even lesser dislocations humans non humans social ecological systems seen problematic
The film Blade Runner novels The Boys From Brazil The Island Doctor Moreau depict elements scenarios Mary Shelley novel Frankenstein often alluded critics suggest biotechnologies could create objectified socially unmoored people well subhumans
Such critics propose strict measures implemented prevent portray dehumanizing possibilities ever happening usually form international ban human genetic engineering Science journalist Ronald Bailey claims McKibben historical examples flawed support different conclusions studied closely
For example groups cautious Amish embracing new technologies though shun television use horses buggies welcoming possibilities gene therapy since inbreeding afflicted number rare genetic diseases
Bailey supporters technological alteration human biology also reject claim life would experienced meaningless human limitations overcome enhancement technologies extremely subjective
Writing Reason magazine Bailey accused opponents research involving modification animals indulging alarmism speculate creation subhuman creatures human like intelligence brains resembling Homo sapiens
Bailey insists aim conducting research animals simply produce human health care benefits A different response comes transhumanist personhood theorists object characterize anthropomorphobia fueling criticisms research science fiction writer Isaac Asimov termed Frankenstein complex
For example Woody Evans argues provided self aware human clones human animal chimeras uplifted animals would unique persons deserving respect dignity rights responsibilities citizenship
They conclude coming ethical issue creation called monsters characterize yuck factor human racism would judge treat creations monstrous At least one public interest organization U S based Center Genetics Society formed specific goal opposing transhumanist agendas involve transgenerational modification human biology full term human cloning germinal choice technology
The Institute Biotechnology Human Future Chicago Kent College Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications genetic nanotechnologies human biology academic setting
Socioeconomic effects Some critics libertarian transhumanism focused likely socioeconomic consequences societies divisions rich poor rise
Bill McKibben example suggests emerging human enhancement technologies would disproportionately available greater financial resources thereby exacerbating gap rich poor creating genetic divide
Even Lee M Silver biologist science writer coined term reprogenetics supports applications expressed concern methods could create two tiered society genetically engineered haves nots social democratic reforms lag behind implementation enhancement technologies
The film Gattaca depicts dystopian society one social class depends entirely genetic modifications often cited critics support views These criticisms also voiced non libertarian transhumanist advocates especially self described democratic transhumanists believe majority current future social environmental issues unemployment resource depletion need addressed combination political technological solutions like guaranteed minimum income alternative technology
Therefore specific issue emerging genetic divide due unequal access human enhancement technologies bioethicist James Hughes book Citizen Cyborg Why Democratic Societies Must Respond Redesigned Human Future argues progressives precisely techno progressives must articulate implement public policies e universal health care voucher system covers human enhancement technologies order attenuate problem much possible rather trying ban human enhancement technologies
The latter argues might actually worsen problem making technologies unsafe available wealthy local black market countries ban enforced Sometimes writings Leon Kass fear various institutions practices judged fundamental civilized society would damaged destroyed
In book Our Posthuman Future Foreign Policy magazine article political economist philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism world dangerous idea believes may undermine egalitarian ideals democracy general liberal democracy particular fundamental alteration human nature
Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas makes similar argument book The Future Human Nature asserts moral autonomy depends subject another unilaterally imposed specifications
Habermas thus suggests human species ethic would undermined embryo stage genetic alteration
Critics Kass Fukuyama variety authors hold attempts significantly alter human biology inherently immoral also threaten social order
Alternatively argue implementation technologies would likely lead naturalizing social hierarchies place new means control hands totalitarian regimes
AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes sees misanthropic tendencies language ideas colleagues particular Marvin Minsky Hans Moravec devaluing human organism per se promotes discourse enables divisive undemocratic social policies In article libertarian monthly Reason science journalist Ronald Bailey contested assertions Fukuyama arguing political equality never rested facts human biology
He asserts liberalism founded proposition effective equality human beings de facto equality assertion equality political rights law de jure equality
Bailey asserts products genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather exacerbate human inequality giving many privileges
Moreover argues crowning achievement Enlightenment principle tolerance
In fact says political liberalism already solution issue human posthuman rights since liberal societies law meant apply equally matter rich poor powerful powerless educated ignorant enhanced unenhanced
Other thinkers sympathetic transhumanist ideas philosopher Russell Blackford also objected appeal tradition see alarmism involved Brave New World type arguments
Cultural aesthetics In addition socio economic risks implications transhumanism indeed implications possible consequences regard cultural aesthetics
Currently number ways people choose represent society
The way person dresses hair styles body alteration serve identify way person presents perceived society
According Foucault society already governs controls bodies making feel watched
This surveillance society dictates majority individuals choose express aesthetically
One risks outlined article Jerold Abrams elimination differences favor universality
This argues eliminate ability individuals subvert possibly oppressive dominant structure society way uniquely expressing externally
Such control population would dangerous implications tyranny
Yet another consequence enhancing human form cognitively physically reinforcement desirable traits perpetuated dominant social structure
Physical traits seen ugly undesirable thus deemed less summarily cut afford cannot forced relative caste undesirable people
Even physical improvements made completely universal indeed eliminate makes individual uniquely human way
Specter coercive eugenicism Some critics transhumanism see old eugenics social Darwinist master race ideologies programs past warnings promotion eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage
Some fear future eugenics wars worst case scenario return coercive state sponsored genetic discrimination human rights violations compulsory sterilization persons genetic defects killing institutionalized specifically segregation genocide races perceived inferior
Health law professor George Annas technology law professor Lori Andrews prominent advocates position use technologies could lead human posthuman caste warfare The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn coercion involved policies reject racist classist assumptions based along pseudoscientific notions eugenic improvements could accomplished practically meaningful time frame selective human breeding
Instead transhumanist thinkers advocate new eugenics form egalitarian liberal eugenics
In book From Chance Choice Genetics Justice non transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan Dan Brock Norman Daniels Daniel Wikler argued liberal societies obligation encourage wide adoption eugenic enhancement technologies possible long policies infringe individuals reproductive rights exert undue pressures prospective parents use technologies order maximize public health minimize inequalities may result natural genetic endowments unequal access genetic enhancements
Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance term eugenics preferring germinal choice reprogenetics avoid position confused discredited theories practices early th century eugenic movements
Existential risks In book Our Final Hour British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues advanced science technology bring much risk disaster opportunity progress
However Rees advocate halt scientific activity
Instead calls tighter security perhaps end traditional scientific openness
Advocates precautionary principle many environmental movement also favor slow careful progress halt potentially dangerous areas
Some precautionists believe artificial intelligence robotics present possibilities alternative forms cognition may threaten human life Transhumanists necessarily rule specific restrictions emerging technologies lessen prospect existential risk
Generally however counter proposals based precautionary principle often unrealistic sometimes even counter productive opposed technogaian current transhumanism claim realistic productive
In television series Connections science historian James Burke dissects several views technological change including precautionism restriction open inquiry
Burke questions practicality views concludes maintaining status quo inquiry development poses hazards disorienting rate change depletion planet resources
The common transhumanist position pragmatic one society takes deliberate action ensure early arrival benefits safe clean alternative technology rather fostering considers anti scientific views technophobia
Nick Bostrom argues even barring occurrence singular global catastrophic event basic Malthusian evolutionary forces facilitated technological progress threaten eliminate positive aspects human society One transhumanist solution proposed Bostrom counter existential risks control differential technological development series attempts influence sequence technologies developed
In approach planners would strive retard development possibly harmful technologies applications accelerating development likely beneficial technologies especially offer protection harmful effects others
Authenticity transhuman goals Lara Prendergast stated goals transhumanism trying cut food sex inauthentic would remove two great joys life
She called transhumanism part new narcissism

Aurora novel American science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson
The novel concerns generation ship built style Stanford torus traveling Tau Ceti order begin human colony
The novel primary narrating voice starship artificial intelligence
The novel well received critics
Plot A generation ship launched Saturn c e
traveling km hr speed light
It includes twenty four self contained biomes average population two thousand people
One hundred sixty years approximately seven generations later beginning deceleration Tau Ceti system begin colonization planet moon Earth analog named Aurora
Devi ship de facto chief engineer leader concerned decaying infrastructure biology ship systems breaking generation lower intelligence test scores last bacteria mutating evolving faster rate humans
She tells ship AI referred simply Ship keep narrative voyage
After trouble understanding human concept narrative Ship eventually elects follow life Devi daughter Freya protagonist
As teenager Freya travels around ship wanderjahr learns many ship inhabitants dissatisfied enclosed existence perceive dictatorship
Movement strictly limited people reproduction tightly controlled education science mathematics mandatory
Freya wanderjahr comes end called home Devi grows sick cancer dies
The ship arrives Tau Ceti system begins settle Aurora moon Tau Ceti e It soon becomes apparent extraterrestrial life present form primitive prions infect kill landing party
All except one remaining settlers attempt return ship remaining onboard kill airlock maintain quarantine leading violent political schism throughout ship
The ship moving towards self awareness takes physical control situation lowering oxygen levels separating warring factions referring rule law
It reveals crew fact two ships originally launched Tau Ceti expedition destroyed period severe civil unrest collective memory event erased history records
Under Ship moderation peaceful debate takes place inhabitants Aurora known inhospitable
Unable reach consensus factions agree part ways wish stay retaining many resources spared pursue unlikely attempt terraforming Mars like planet Iris group led Freya opt try return Earth
Using raw materials Tau Ceti system refuel ship allow acceleration back Earth since lack fuel decelerate must rely laser propulsion system originally launched solar system slow approach
The last remaining Aurora settler remains permanently quarantined shuttle attached exterior ship elects return Earth well
Initially Freya others return remain communication remained Tau Ceti system much later voyage home communication stops
On voyage back Earth ship biomes continue deteriorate bacteria flourish crops fail
The humans soon face famine experiment untested form cryogenic freezing largely successful
The ship repeated entreaties Earth turn back laser propulsion system ignored due societal political strife back Solar System many citizens anger colonists cowardice
Eventually private group funds reactivates laser delay means ship speed reduced fraction needed
Ship therefore forced decelerate means gravity assist various planets process takes twelve years
During time full communications data humanity available learns launched first place simply expansionism denounces builders criminally negligent narcissists
Ship manages safely drop humans pass Earth fails make final gravity slowdown past Sun Ship destroyed along last survivor landing Aurora
Freya starfarers trouble adjusting life Earth especially many Terrans hostile perceived sense ingratitude cowardice
At space colonization conference speaker says humanity continue send ships interstellar space matter many fail die Freya assaults
Eventually joins group terraformers attempting restore Earth beaches loss previous centuries sea level rise
While swimming surfing begins come terms life Earth
Major themes Major themes Aurora include complexities life aboard multi generational starship interpersonal psychology artificial intelligence human migration environmentalism feasibility star travel

Concept mining activity results extraction concepts artifacts
Solutions task typically involve aspects artificial intelligence statistics data mining text mining
Because artifacts typically loosely structured sequence words symbols rather concepts problem nontrivial provide powerful insights meaning provenance similarity documents
Methods Traditionally conversion words concepts performed using thesaurus computational techniques tendency
The thesauri used either specially created task pre existing language model usually related Princeton WordNet
The mappings words concepts often ambiguous
Typically word given language relate several possible concepts
Humans use context disambiguate various meanings given piece text available machine translation systems cannot easily infer context
For purposes concept mining however ambiguities tend less important machine translation large documents ambiguities tend even much case text mining
There many techniques disambiguation may used
Examples linguistic analysis text use word concept association frequency information may inferred large text corpora
Recently techniques base semantic similarity possible concepts context appeared gained interest scientific community
Applications Detecting indexing similar documents large corpora One spin offs calculating document statistics concept domain rather word domain concepts form natural tree structures based hypernymy meronymy
These structures used produce simple tree membership statistics used locate document Euclidean concept space
If size document also considered another dimension space extremely efficient indexing system created
This technique currently commercial use locating similar legal documents million document corpus
Clustering documents topic Standard numeric clustering techniques may used concept space described locate index documents inferred topic
These numerically far efficient text mining cousins tend behave intuitively map better similarity measures human would generate

So v displaystyle v_ v j displaystyle v_ j connected edge junction tree message v displaystyle v_ v j displaystyle v_ j set table values given function μ j displaystyle mu _ j A S S j R displaystyle A_ S_ cap S_ j rightarrow R
To begin functions e

To solve All Vertices problem schedule GDL several ways parallel implementation round every state updated every message computed transmitted time

We compare number operations required calculated using normal method Here normal method mean methods use message passing junction trees short methods use concepts GDL number operations using generalized distributive law

To evaluate expression naively requires two multiplications one addition
The expression expressed using distributive law written b c displaystyle b c simple optimization reduces number operations one addition one multiplication
Similar explained example expressing equations different forms perform operation possible applying GDL
As explained previous sections solve problem using concept junction trees
The optimization obtained use trees comparable optimization obtained solving semi group problem trees
For example find minimum group numbers observe tree elements bottom tree compare minimum two items parallel resultant minimum written parent
When process propagated tree minimum group elements found root
The following complexity solving junction tree using message passing We rewrite formula used earlier following form
This eqn message sent vertex v w μ v w p v w p v w A S v S w α v p v u j v u v μ u v p u v displaystyle mu _ v w p_ v cap w sum _ p_ v setminus w A_ S v setminus S w alpha _ v p_ v prod _ uadjv_ u neq v mu _ u v p_ u cap v message equationSimilarly rewrite equation calculating state vertex v follows σ v p v α v p v u adj v μ v w p v w displaystyle sigma _ v p_ v alpha _ v p_ v prod _ u operatorname adj v mu _ v w p_ v cap w We first analyze single vertex problem assume target vertex v displaystyle v_ hence one edge v displaystyle v v displaystyle v_
Suppose edge v w displaystyle v w calculate message using message equation
To calculate p u v displaystyle p_ u cap v requires q v w displaystyle q_ v setminus w additions q v w v displaystyle q_ v setminus w v multiplications
We represent A S v S w displaystyle A_ S v S w q v w displaystyle q_ v setminus w
But many possibilities x v w displaystyle x_ v cap w hence q v w e f A S v S w displaystyle q_ v cap w stackrel mathrm def A_ S v cap S w possibilities p v w displaystyle p_ v cap w
Thus entire message need q v w q v w q v q v w displaystyle q_ v cap w q_ v setminus w q_ v q_ v cap w additions q v w q v w
v v q v displaystyle q_ v cap w q_ v setminus w
v v q_ v multiplications The total number arithmetic operations required send message towards v displaystyle v_ along edges tree v v q v q v w displaystyle sum _ v neq v q_ v q_ v cap w additions v v v q v displaystyle sum _ v neq v v q_ v multiplications
Once messages transmitted algorithm terminates computation state v displaystyle v_ The state computation requires v q displaystyle v_ q_ multiplications
Thus number calculations required calculate state given v v q v q v w displaystyle sum _ v neq v_ q_ v q_ v cap w additions v v v q v v q v displaystyle sum _ v neq v_ v q_ v v_ q_ v_ multiplications Thus grand total number calculations χ T v V v q v e E q e displaystyle chi T sum _ v V v q_ v sum _ e E q_ e displaystyle e v w displaystyle e v w edge size defined q v w displaystyle q_ v cap w The formula gives us upper bound
If define complexity edge e v w displaystyle e v w χ e q v q w q v w displaystyle chi e q_ v q_ w q_ v cap w Therefore displaystyle written χ T e E χ e displaystyle chi T sum _ e E chi e We calculate edge complexity problem defined Figure follows χ q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ χ q q q q q displaystyle chi q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ The total complexity q q q q q q q q q q q q q displaystyle q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ q_ considerably low compared direct method

Now consider vertex problem message sent directions state must computed vertexes
This would take O v v v q v displaystyle O sum _ v v v q_ v precomputing reduce number multiplications displaystyle

It possible compute products displaystyle displaystyle a_ displaystyle multiplications rather obvious displaystyle
We precomputing quantities b b b b b displaystyle b_ a_ b_ b_ cdot a_ a_ cdot a_ b_ b_ cdot a_ a_ a_ cdots a_ c c c c c displaystyle c_ a_ c_ a_ c_ a_ cdot a_ ldots c_ a_ cdot c_ a_ a_ cdots a_ takes displaystyle multiplications
Then j displaystyle m_ j denotes product displaystyle a_ except j displaystyle a_ j c b c displaystyle m_ c_ m_ b_ cdot c_ need another displaystyle multiplications making total displaystyle There much comes construction junction tree except may many maximal weight spanning tree choose spanning tree least χ T displaystyle chi T sometimes might mean adding local domain lower junction tree complexity
It may seem GDL correct local domains expressed junction tree
But even cases cycles number iterations messages approximately equal objective function
The experiments Gallager Tanner Wiberg algorithm low density parity check codes supportive claim

How artificial imagination contribute interactive search Artificial imagination allows us synthesize images develop new image whether database regardless existence real world
For example computer shows results based answer initial query
The user selects several relevant images technology analyzes selections reorganizes images ranks fit query
In process artificial imagination used synthesize selected images improve searching result additional relevant synthesized images
This technique based several algorithms including Rocchio algorithm evolutionary algorithm
The Rocchio algorithm locating query point near relevant examples far away irrelevant examples simple works well small system databases arranged certain ranks
The evolutionary synthesis composed two steps standard algorithm enhancement standard algorithm
Through feedback user would additional images synthesized suited user looking

The traditional fields artificial imagination include visual imagination aural imagination
More generally actions form ideas images concepts linked imagination
Thus artificial imagination means generating graphs
For example moral imagination important research subfield artificial imagination although classification artificial imagination difficult
Morals important part human beings logic artificial morals important artificial imagination artificial intelligence
A common criticism artificial intelligence whether human beings take responsibility machines mistakes decisions develop well behaved machines
As nobody give clear description best moral rules impossible create machines commonly accepted moral rules
However recent research artificial morals circumvent definition moral
Instead machine learning methods applied train machines imitate human morals
As data moral decisions thousands different people considered trained moral model reflect widely accepted rules
Memory another big field artificial imagination

Type fuzzy sets systems generalize standard Type fuzzy sets systems uncertainty handled
From beginning fuzzy sets criticism made fact membership function type fuzzy set uncertainty associated something seems contradict word fuzzy since word connotation lots uncertainty
So one uncertainty value membership function
The answer question provided inventor fuzzy sets Prof Lotfi A Zadeh proposed sophisticated kinds fuzzy sets first called type fuzzy set
A type fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty membership function fuzzy set theory way address criticism type fuzzy sets head
And uncertainty type fuzzy set reduces type fuzzy set analogous probability reducing determinism unpredictability vanishes
In order symbolically distinguish type fuzzy set type fuzzy set tilde symbol put symbol fuzzy set A denotes type fuzzy set whereas Ã denotes comparable type fuzzy set
When latter done resulting type fuzzy set called general type fuzzy set distinguish special interval type fuzzy set
Prof Zadeh stop type fuzzy sets paper also generalized type n fuzzy sets
The present article focuses type fuzzy sets next step logical progression type type n fuzzy sets n
Although researchers beginning explore higher type fuzzy sets early work infancy
The membership function general type fuzzy set Ã three dimensional Fig
third dimension value membership function point two dimensional domain called footprint uncertainty FOU
For interval type fuzzy set third dimension value e g everywhere means new information contained third dimension interval type fuzzy set
So set third dimension ignored FOU used describe
It reason interval type fuzzy set sometimes called first order uncertainty fuzzy set model whereas general type fuzzy set useful third dimension sometimes referred second order uncertainty fuzzy set model
The FOU represents blurring type membership function completely described two bounding functions Fig
lower membership function LMF upper membership function UMF type fuzzy sets
Consequently possible use type fuzzy set mathematics characterize work interval type fuzzy sets
This means engineers scientists already know type fuzzy sets invest lot time learning general type fuzzy set mathematics order understand use interval type fuzzy sets
Work type fuzzy sets languished early mid although small number articles published
People still trying figure type fuzzy sets even though Zadeh proposed type fuzzy sets time right researchers drop type fuzzy sets focus type fuzzy sets
This changed latter part result Prof Jerry Mendel student works type fuzzy sets systems
Since researchers around world writing articles type fuzzy sets systems
Interval Type Fuzzy Sets Interval type fuzzy sets received attention mathematics needed sets primarily Interval arithmetic much simpler mathematics needed general type fuzzy sets
So literature interval type fuzzy sets large whereas literature general type fuzzy sets much smaller
Both kinds fuzzy sets actively researched ever growing number researchers around world resulted successful employment variety domains robot control Formilleri following already worked interval type fuzzy sets Fuzzy set operations union intersection complement Centroid widely used operation practitioners sets also important uncertainty measure Other uncertainty measures fuzziness cardinality variance skewness uncertainty bounds Similarity Subsethood Embedded fuzzy sets Fuzzy set ranking Fuzzy rule ranking selection Type reduction methods Firing intervals interval type fuzzy logic system Fuzzy weighted average Linguistic weighted average Synthesizing FOU data collected group subject Interval Type Fuzzy Logic Systems Type fuzzy sets finding wide applicability rule based fuzzy logic systems FLSs let uncertainties modeled whereas uncertainties cannot modeled type fuzzy sets
A block diagram type FLS depicted Fig

This kind FLS used fuzzy logic control fuzzy logic signal processing rule based classification etc sometimes referred function approximation application fuzzy sets FLS designed minimize error function
The following discussions four components Fig
rule based FLS given interval type FLS date popular kind type FLS however discussions also applicable general type FLS
Rules either provided subject experts extracted numerical data expressed collection IF THEN statements e g IF temperature moderate pressure high rotate valve bit right Fuzzy sets associated terms appear antecedents IF part consequents THEN part rules inputs outputs FLS
Membership functions used describe fuzzy sets type FLS type fuzzy sets whereas interval type FLS least one membership function interval type fuzzy set
An interval type FLS lets one following kinds uncertainties quantified Words used antecedents consequents rules words mean different things different people
Uncertain consequents rules obtained group experts consequents often different rule e
experts necessarily agreement
Membership function parameters parameters optimized using uncertain noisy training data parameters become uncertain
Noisy measurements often measurements activate FLS In Fig
measured crisp inputs first transformed fuzzy sets Fuzzifier block fuzzy sets numbers activate rules described terms fuzzy sets numbers
Three kinds fuzzifiers possible interval type FLS
When measurements Perfect modeled crisp set Noisy noise stationary modeled type fuzzy set Noisy noise non stationary modeled interval type fuzzy set latter kind fuzzification cannot done type FLS In Fig
measurements fuzzified resulting input fuzzy sets mapped fuzzy output sets Inference block
This accomplished first quantifying rule using fuzzy set theory using mathematics fuzzy sets establish output rule help inference mechanism
If M rules fuzzy input sets Inference block activate subset rules subset contains least one rule usually way fewer M rules
Inference done one rule time
So output Inference block one fired rule fuzzy output sets
In engineering applications FLS number fuzzy set needed final output e g consequent rule given Rotate valve bit right
No automatic valve know means bit right linguistic expression valve must turned numerical values e
certain number degrees
Consequently fired rule output fuzzy sets converted number done Fig
Output Processing block
In type FLS output processing called Defuzzification maps type fuzzy set number
There many ways e g compute union fired rule output fuzzy sets result another type fuzzy set compute center gravity membership function set compute weighted average center gravities fired rule consequent membership functions etc
Things somewhat complicated interval type FLS go interval type fuzzy set number usually requires two steps Fig

The first step called type reduction interval type fuzzy set reduced interval valued type fuzzy set
There many type reduction methods type defuzzification methods
An algorithm developed Karnik Mendel known KM Algorithm used type reduction
Although algorithm iterative fast
The second step Output Processing occurs type reduction still called defuzzification
Because type reduced set interval type fuzzy set always finite interval numbers defuzzified value average two end points interval
It clear Fig
two outputs interval type FLS crisp numerical values type reduced set
The latter provides measure uncertainties flowed interval type FLS due possibly uncertain input measurements activated rules whose antecedents consequents uncertain
Just standard deviation widely used probability statistics provide measure unpredictable uncertainty mean value type reduced set provided measure uncertainty crisp output interval type FLS
Computing words Another application fuzzy sets also inspired Prof Zadeh Computing With Words
Different acronyms used computing words e g CW CWW
According Zadeh CWW methodology objects computation words propositions drawn natural language
It inspired remarkable human capability perform wide variety physical mental tasks without measurements computations Of course mean computers would actually compute using words single words phrases rather numbers
He meant computers would activated words would converted mathematical representation using fuzzy sets fuzzy sets would mapped CWW engine fuzzy set latter would converted back word
A natural question ask Which kind fuzzy set type type used model word
Mendel argued basis Karl Popper concept Falsificationism using type fuzzy set model word scientifically incorrect
An interval type fuzzy set used first order uncertainty model word
Much research way CWW

The user illusion illusion created user human computer interface example visual metaphor desktop used many graphical user interfaces
The phrase originated Xerox PARC Some philosophers mind argued consciousness form user illusion
This notion explored Tor Nørretranders Danish book Mærk verden issued English edition The User Illusion Cutting Consciousness Down Size
He introduced idea exformation book
Philosopher Daniel Dennett also embraced view human consciousness user illusion
According picture experience world immediate sensation requires processing time
It follows conscious experience less perfect reflection occurring simulation produced unconsciously brain
Therefore may phenomena exist beyond peripheries beyond consciousness could create isolate reduce
Criticism Critics idea consciousness device justifying preconceptions argue device would consume nutrients without producing useful results since would change outcome decisions
These critics argue existence social insects extremely small brains falsifies notion social behavior requires consciousness citing insects small brains conscious yet observed behaviors among functional intents purposes match complex social cooperation manipulation including hierarchies individual place among paper wasps Jack Jumper ants honey bees sneaking lay eggs
These critics also argue since social behavior insects extremely small brained animals evolved multiple times independently evolutionary difficulty simple reaction sociality impose selection pressure nutrient consuming path consciousness sociality
These critics point evolutionary paths consciousness possible critical evaluation enhances plasticity criticizing fallible notions pointing critical consciousness would quite different justificatory type proposed Nørretranders differences including critical consciousness would make individuals capable changing minds instead justifying persuading

Natural language processing NLP subfield linguistics computer science information engineering artificial intelligence concerned interactions computers human natural languages particular program computers process analyze large amounts natural language data
Challenges natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding natural language generation
History The history natural language processing NLP generally started although work found earlier periods
In Alan Turing published article titled Computing Machinery Intelligence proposed called Turing test criterion intelligence
The Georgetown experiment involved fully automatic translation sixty Russian sentences English
The authors claimed within three five years machine translation would solved problem
However real progress much slower ALPAC report found ten year long research failed fulfill expectations funding machine translation dramatically reduced
Little research machine translation conducted late first statistical machine translation systems developed
Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed SHRDLU natural language system working restricted blocks worlds restricted vocabularies ELIZA simulation Rogerian psychotherapist written Joseph Weizenbaum
Using almost information human thought emotion ELIZA sometimes provided startlingly human like interaction

Up natural language processing systems based complex sets hand written rules
Starting late however revolution natural language processing introduction machine learning algorithms language processing
This due steady increase computational power see Moore law gradual lessening dominance Chomskyan theories linguistics e g
transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort corpus linguistics underlies machine learning approach language processing
Some earliest used machine learning algorithms decision trees produced systems hard rules similar existing hand written rules
However part speech tagging introduced use hidden Markov models natural language processing increasingly research focused statistical models make soft probabilistic decisions based attaching real valued weights features making input data
The cache language models upon many speech recognition systems rely examples statistical models
Such models generally robust given unfamiliar input especially input contains errors common real world data produce reliable results integrated larger system comprising multiple subtasks
Many notable early successes occurred field machine translation due especially work IBM Research successively complicated statistical models developed
These systems able take advantage existing multilingual textual corpora produced Parliament Canada European Union result laws calling translation governmental proceedings official languages corresponding systems government
However systems depended corpora specifically developed tasks implemented systems often continues major limitation success systems
As result great deal research gone methods effectively learning limited amounts data
Recent research increasingly focused unsupervised semi supervised learning algorithms
Such algorithms learn data hand annotated desired answers using combination annotated non annotated data
Generally task much difficult supervised learning typically produces less accurate results given amount input data
However enormous amount non annotated data available including among things entire content World Wide Web often make inferior results algorithm used low enough time complexity practical
In representation learning deep neural network style machine learning methods became widespread natural language processing due part flurry results showing techniques achieve state art results many natural language tasks example language modeling parsing many others
Popular techniques include use word embeddings capture semantic properties words increase end end learning higher level task e g question answering instead relying pipeline separate intermediate tasks e g part speech tagging dependency parsing
In areas shift entailed substantial changes NLP systems designed deep neural network based approaches may viewed new paradigm distinct statistical natural language processing
For instance term neural machine translation NMT emphasizes fact deep learning based approaches machine translation directly learn sequence sequence transformations obviating need intermediate steps word alignment language modeling used statistical machine translation SMT
Rule based vs statistical NLP In early days many language processing systems designed hand coding set rules writing grammars devising heuristic rules stemming
Since called statistical revolution late mid much natural language processing research relied heavily machine learning
The machine learning paradigm calls instead using statistical inference automatically learn rules analysis large corpora plural form corpus set documents possibly human computer annotations typical real world examples
Many different classes machine learning algorithms applied natural language processing tasks
These algorithms take input large set features generated input data
Some earliest used algorithms decision trees produced systems hard rules similar systems handwritten rules common
Increasingly however research focused statistical models make soft probabilistic decisions based attaching real valued weights input feature
Such models advantage express relative certainty many different possible answers rather one producing reliable results model included component larger system
Systems based machine learning algorithms many advantages hand produced rules The learning procedures used machine learning automatically focus common cases whereas writing rules hand often obvious effort directed
Automatic learning procedures make use statistical inference algorithms produce models robust unfamiliar input e g
containing words structures seen erroneous input e g
misspelled words words accidentally omitted
Generally handling input gracefully handwritten rules generally creating systems handwritten rules make soft decisions extremely difficult error prone time consuming
Systems based automatically learning rules made accurate simply supplying input data
However systems based handwritten rules made accurate increasing complexity rules much difficult task
In particular limit complexity systems based handcrafted rules beyond systems become unmanageable
However creating data input machine learning systems simply requires corresponding increase number man hours worked generally without significant increases complexity annotation process
Major evaluations tasks The following list commonly researched tasks natural language processing
Some tasks direct real world applications others commonly serve subtasks used aid solving larger tasks
Though natural language processing tasks closely intertwined frequently subdivided categories convenience
A coarse division given
Syntax Grammar induction Generate formal grammar describes language syntax
Lemmatization The task removing inflectional endings return base dictionary form word also known lemma
Morphological segmentation Separate words individual morphemes identify class morphemes
The difficulty task depends greatly complexity morphology e
structure words language considered
English fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology thus often possible ignore task entirely simply model possible forms word e g
open opens opened opening separate words
In languages Turkish Meitei highly agglutinated Indian language however approach possible dictionary entry thousands possible word forms
Part speech tagging Given sentence determine part speech POS word
Many words especially common ones serve multiple parts speech
For example book noun book table verb book flight set noun verb adjective least five different parts speech
Some languages ambiguity others
Languages little inflectional morphology English particularly prone ambiguity
Chinese prone ambiguity tonal language verbalization
Such inflection readily conveyed via entities employed within orthography convey intended meaning
Parsing Determine parse tree grammatical analysis given sentence
The grammar natural languages ambiguous typical sentences multiple possible analyses
Perhaps surprisingly typical sentence may thousands potential parses seem completely nonsensical human
There two primary types parsing Dependency Parsing Constituency Parsing
Dependency Parsing focuses relationships words sentence marking things like Primary Objects predicates whereas Constituency Parsing focuses building Parse Tree using Probabilistic Context Free Grammar PCFG
See also Stochastic grammar
Sentence breaking also known sentence boundary disambiguation Given chunk text find sentence boundaries
Sentence boundaries often marked periods punctuation marks characters serve purposes e g
marking abbreviations
Stemming The process reducing inflected sometimes derived words root form
e g
close root closed closing close closer etc
Word segmentation Separate chunk continuous text separate words
For language like English fairly trivial since words usually separated spaces
However written languages like Chinese Japanese Thai mark word boundaries fashion languages text segmentation significant task requiring knowledge vocabulary morphology words language
Sometimes process also used cases like Bag Words BOW creation data mining
Terminology extraction The goal terminology extraction automatically extract relevant terms given corpus
Semantics Lexical semantics What computational meaning individual words context
Distributional semantics How learn semantic representations data
Machine translation Automatically translate text one human language another
This one difficult problems member class problems colloquially termed AI complete e
requiring different types knowledge humans possess grammar semantics facts real world etc
solve properly
Named entity recognition NER Given stream text determine items text map proper names people places type name e g
person location organization
Although capitalization aid recognizing named entities languages English information cannot aid determining type named entity case often inaccurate insufficient
For example first letter sentence also capitalized named entities often span several words capitalized
Furthermore many languages non Western scripts e g
Chinese Arabic capitalization even languages capitalization may consistently use distinguish names
For example German capitalizes nouns regardless whether names French Spanish capitalize names serve adjectives
Natural language generation Convert information computer databases semantic intents readable human language
Natural language understanding Convert chunks text formal representations first order logic structures easier computer programs manipulate
Natural language understanding involves identification intended semantic multiple possible semantics derived natural language expression usually takes form organized notations natural language concepts
Introduction creation language metamodel ontology efficient however empirical solutions
An explicit formalization natural language semantics without confusions implicit assumptions closed world assumption CWA vs open world assumption subjective Yes No vs objective True False expected construction basis semantics formalization
Optical character recognition OCR Given image representing printed text determine corresponding text
Question answering Given human language question determine answer
Typical questions specific right answer What capital Canada
sometimes open ended questions also considered What meaning life
Recent works looked even complex questions
Recognizing Textual entailment Given two text fragments determine one true entails entails negation allows either true false
Relationship extraction Given chunk text identify relationships among named entities e g
married
Sentiment analysis see also multimodal sentiment analysis Extract subjective information usually set documents often using online reviews determine polarity specific objects
It especially useful identifying trends public opinion social media marketing
Topic segmentation recognition Given chunk text separate segments devoted topic identify topic segment
Word sense disambiguation Many words one meaning select meaning makes sense context
For problem typically given list words associated word senses e g
dictionary online resource WordNet
Discourse Automatic summarization Produce readable summary chunk text
Often used provide summaries text known type research papers articles financial section newspaper
Coreference resolution Given sentence larger chunk text determine words mentions refer objects entities
Anaphora resolution specific example task specifically concerned matching pronouns nouns names refer
The general task coreference resolution also includes identifying called bridging relationships involving referring expressions
For example sentence He entered John house front door front door referring expression bridging relationship identified fact door referred front door John house rather structure might also referred
Discourse analysis This rubric includes several related tasks
One task identifying discourse structure connected text e
nature discourse relationships sentences e g
elaboration explanation contrast
Another possible task recognizing classifying speech acts chunk text e g
yes question content question statement assertion etc
Speech Speech recognition Given sound clip person people speaking determine textual representation speech
This opposite text speech one extremely difficult problems colloquially termed AI complete see
In natural speech hardly pauses successive words thus speech segmentation necessary subtask speech recognition see
In spoken languages sounds representing successive letters blend process termed coarticulation conversion analog signal discrete characters difficult process
Also given words language spoken people different accents speech recognition software must able recognize wide variety input identical terms textual equivalent
Speech segmentation Given sound clip person people speaking separate words
A subtask speech recognition typically grouped
Text speech Given text transform units produce spoken representation
Text speech used aid visually impaired
Dialogue The first published work artificial intelligence published Road marketed novel contains sixty million words

Moravec paradox observation artificial intelligence robotics researchers contrary traditional assumptions reasoning high level humans requires little computation sensorimotor skills comparatively low level humans require enormous computational resources
The principle articulated Hans Moravec Rodney Brooks Marvin Minsky others
As Moravec writes comparatively easy make computers exhibit adult level performance intelligence tests playing checkers difficult impossible give skills one year old comes perception mobility Similarly Minsky emphasized difficult human skills reverse engineer unconscious
In general least aware minds best wrote added aware simple processes work well complex ones work flawlessly
The biological basis human skills One possible explanation paradox offered Moravec based evolution
All human skills implemented biologically using machinery designed process natural selection
In course evolution natural selection tended preserve design improvements optimizations
The older skill time natural selection improve design
Abstract thought developed recently consequently expect implementation particularly efficient
As Moravec writes Encoded large highly evolved sensory motor portions human brain billion years experience nature world survive
The deliberate process call reasoning I believe thinnest veneer human thought effective supported much older much powerful though usually unconscious sensorimotor knowledge
We prodigious olympians perceptual motor areas good make difficult look easy
Abstract thought though new trick perhaps less thousand years old

Means ends analysis MEA problem solving technique used commonly artificial intelligence AI limiting search AI programs
It also technique used least since creativity tool frequently mentioned engineering books design methods
MEA also related means ends chain approach used commonly consumer behavior analysis
It also way clarify one thoughts embarking mathematical proof
Problem solving search An important aspect intelligent behavior studied AI goal based problem solving framework solution problem described finding sequence actions lead desirable goal
A goal seeking system supposed connected outside environment sensory channels receives information environment motor channels acts environment
The term afferent used describe inward sensory flows efferent used describe outward motor commands
In addition system means storing memory information state environment afferent information information actions efferent information
Ability attain goals depends building associations simple complex particular changes states particular actions bring changes
Search process discovery assembly sequences actions lead given state desired state
While strategy may appropriate machine learning problem solving always suggested humans e g
cognitive load theory implications
How means ends analysis works The MEA technique strategy control search problem solving
Given current state goal state action chosen reduce difference two
The action performed current state produce new state process recursively applied new state goal state
Note order MEA effective goal seeking system must means associating kind detectable difference actions relevant reducing difference
It must also means detecting progress making changes differences actual desired state attempted sequences actions may fail hence alternate sequences may tried
When knowledge available concerning importance differences important difference selected first improve average performance MEA brute force search strategies
However even without ordering differences according importance MEA improves search heuristics average case focusing problem solving actual differences current state goal
Some AI systems using MEA The MEA technique problem solving strategy first introduced Allen Newell Herbert A Simon computer problem solving program General Problem Solver GPS
In implementation correspondence differences actions also called operators provided priori knowledge system
In GPS knowledge form table connections
When action side effects applying operator penetrable search may select relevant operators inspection operators without table connections
This latter case canonical example STRIPS automated planning computer program allows task independent correlation differences operators reduce
Prodigy problem solver developed larger learning assisted automated planning project started Carnegie Mellon University Jaime Carbonell Steven Minton Craig Knoblock another system used MEA
Professor Morten Lind Technical University Denmark developed tool called multilevel flow modeling MFM

SNePS knowledge representation reasoning acting KRRA system developed maintained Stuart C Shapiro colleagues State University New York Buffalo
SNePS simultaneously logic based frame based network based KRRA system
It uses assertional model knowledge SNePS knowledge base KB consists set assertions propositions various entities
Its intended model intensional domain mental entities entities conceived agent propositions believed
The intensionality primarily accomplished absence built equality operator since two syntactically different terms might slightly different Fregean senses
SNePS three styles inference formula based derived logic based personality slot based derived frame based personality path based derived network based personality
However three integrated operating together
SNePS may used stand alone KRR system
It also used along integrated acting component implement mind intelligent agents cognitive robots accord GLAIR agent architecture layered cognitive architecture
The SNePS Research Group often calls agents Cassie
SNePS Logic Based System As logic based system SNePS KB consists set terms functions formulas terms
The set logical connectives quantifiers extends usual set used first order logics taking one arbitrarily sized sets arguments
In accord intended use SNePS represent mind natural language competent intelligent agent propositions first class entities intended domain formulas actually proposition denoting functional terms
SNePSLOG input output language logic based face SNePS looks like naive logic function symbols including predicates formulas actually proposition denoting terms may arguments functions may quantified
The underlying SNePS however first order logic user function symbols formulas reified
Formula based inference implemented natural deduction style inference engine introduction elimination rules connectives quantifiers
SNePS formula based inference sound complete rules inference less useful natural language understanding commonsense reasoning implemented
A proposition denoting term SNePS KB might might asserted treated true KB
The SNePS logic paraconsistent version relevance logic contradiction imply anything whatsoever
Nevertheless SNeBR SNePS Belief Revision subsystem notice explicit contradiction engage user dialogue repair
SNeBR Assumption Based Truth Maintenance System ATMS removes assertion status proposition whose support removed
SNePS Frame Based System As frame based system every SNePS functional term including proposition valued terms represented frame slots fillers
Each slot may filled arbitrarily sized set terms
However cycles cannot constructed
SNePSUL SNePS User Language input output language interacting SNePS guise frame based system
SNePSLOG may used three modes
In two modes caseframe set slots associated functional term determined system
In mode user declares caseframe used function symbol
In slot based inference proposition valued frame considered imply frame slots filled subset fillers
In current implementation always sound
SNePS Network Based System As network based system SNePS propositional semantic network thus original meaning SNePS The Semantic Network Processing System
This view obtained considering every individual constant every functional term node network every slot directed labeled arc frame node every node filler
In intended interpretation every node denotes mental entity propositions every proposition represented network represented node denotes
Some nodes variables SNePS logic range nodes nodes
Path based inference rules may defined although represented SNePS
A path based inference rule specifies labeled arc r may inferred present node n node case given path exists n There extensive recursive set path constructors available
Components SNIP SNePS Inference Package provides rules inference SNePS deduces new assertions existing KB
SNeBR SNePS Belief Revision package component SNePS detects KB contains contradictory beliefs
When contradiction detected user encouraged unassert one contradictory beliefs unasserting underlying hypotheses led contradiction
As result propositions inferred hypotheses unasserted also unasserted
SNeRE SNePS Rational Engine provides acting executive set frames building complex acts plans set system defined user defined primitive actions
System defined frames allow specification sequences acts conditional acts iteration acts well believing disbelieving propositions
SNeRE policies connect acting inference specifying example certain act done certain proposition believed asserted
SNaLPS SNePS Natural Language Processing System consists Generalized Augmented Transition Network Grammar interpreter English morphological analyzer synthesizer natural language understanding generation may provided SNePS based agents

Emotion oriented computing affective computing gaining importance interactive technological systems become sophisticated
Representing emotional states user emotional states simulated user interface requires suitable representation format case markup language used
EmotionML version published group May
History In first W C Incubator Group Emotion Incubator Group EmoXG set investigate language represent emotional states users emotional states simulated user interfaces final Report published July
In Emotion Markup Language Incubator Group EmotionML XG set follow Emotion Incubator Group propose specification draft Emotion Markup Language document way accessible non experts illustrate use conjunction number existing markups
The final report Emotion Markup Language Incubator Group Elements EmotionML published November
The work continued frame W C Multimodal Interaction Activity First Public Working Draft Emotion Markup Language EmotionML published October
The Last Call Working Draft Emotion Markup Language published April
The Last Call Working Draft addressed open issues arose feedback community First Call Working Draft well results workshop held Paris October
Along Last Call Working Draft list vocabularies EmotionML published aid developers using common vocabularies annotating representing emotions
Annual draft updates published version finished
Reasons defining emotion markup language A standard emotion markup language would useful following purposes To enhance computer mediated human human human machine communication
Emotions basic part human communication therefore taken account e g
emotional Chat systems emphatic voice boxes
This involves specification analysis display emotion related states
To enhance systems processing efficiency
Emotion intelligence strongly interconnected
The modeling human emotions computer processing help build efficient systems e g
using emotional models time critical decision enforcement
To allow analysis non verbal behavior emotion mental states provided using web services enable data collection analysis reporting Concrete examples existing technology could apply EmotionML include Opinion mining sentiment analysis Web automatically track customer attitude regarding product across blogs Affective monitoring ambient assisted living applications fear detection surveillance purposes using wearable sensors test customer satisfaction Wellness technologies provide assistance according person emotional state goal improve person well Character design control games virtual worlds Building web services capture analysis report data non verbal behavior emotion mental states individual group across internet using standard web technologies HTML JSON
Social robots guide robots engaging visitors Expressive speech synthesis generating synthetic speech different emotions happy sad friendly apologetic expressive synthetic speech would example make information available blind partially sighted people enrich experience content Emotion recognition e g spotting angry customers speech dialog systems improve computer games e Learning applications Support people disabilities educational programs people autism
EmotionML used make emotional intent content explicit
This would enable people learning disabilities Asperger Syndrome realise emotional context content EmotionML used media transcripts captions
Where emotions marked help deaf hearing impaired people cannot hear soundtrack information made available enrich experience content The Emotion Incubator Group listed individual use cases Emotion markup language A standardised way mark data needed emotion oriented systems potential boost development primarily data annotated standardised way interchanged systems easily thereby simplifying market emotional databases standard used ease market providers sub modules emotion processing systems e g
web service recognition emotion text speech multi modal input
The challenge defining generally usable emotion markup language Any attempt standardize description emotions using finite set fixed descriptors doomed failure consensus number relevant emotions names given else best describe
For example difference small using standardized markup would make one invalid
Even basically list emotion related states distinguished varies depending application domain aspect emotions focused
Basically vocabulary needed depends context use
On hand basic structure concepts less controversial generally agreed emotions involve triggers appraisals feelings expressive behavior including physiological changes action tendencies emotions entirety described terms categories small number dimensions emotions intensity
For details see Scientific Descriptions Emotions Final Report Emotion Incubator Group
Given lack agreement descriptors field practical way defining emotion markup language definition possible structural elements allow users plug vocabularies consider appropriate work
An additional challenge lies aim provide markup language generally usable
The requirements arise different use cases rather different
Whereas manual annotation tends require fine grained distinctions considered scientific literature automatic recognition systems usually distinguish small number different states affective avatars need yet another level detail expressing emotions appropriate way
For reasons outlined clear inevitable tension flexibility interoperability need weighed formulation EmotionML
The guiding principle following specification provide choice needed propose reasonable default options every choice
Applications web services benefiting emotion markup language There range existing projects applications emotion markup language enable building webservices measure capture data individuals non verbal behavior mental states emotions allowing results reported rendered standardized format using standard web technologies JSON HTML

Example Bayesian spam detection The purpose Bayesian spam filtering eliminate junk e mails
The problem easy formulate
E mails classified one two categories non spam spam
The available information classify e mails content set words
Using words without taking order account commonly called bag words model
The classifier furthermore able adapt user learn experience
Starting initial standard setting classifier modify internal parameters user disagrees decision
It hence adapt user criteria differentiate non spam spam
It improve results encounters increasingly classified e mails
Variables The variables necessary write program follows S p displaystyle Spam binary variable false e mail spam true otherwise
W W W N displaystyle W_ W_ ldots W_ N N displaystyle N binary variables
W n displaystyle W_ n true n h displaystyle n th word dictionary present text These N displaystyle N binary variables sum information e mail
Decomposition Starting joint distribution applying recursively Bayes theorem obtain P Spam W W N P Spam P W Spam P W Spam W P W N Spam W W N displaystyle begin aligned P text Spam wedge W_ wedge cdots wedge W_ N P text Spam times P W_ mid text Spam times P W_ mid text Spam wedge W_ times cdots times P left W_ N mid text Spam wedge W_ wedge cdots wedge W_ N right end aligned This exact mathematical expression
It drastically simplified assuming probability appearance word knowing nature text spam independent appearance words
This naive Bayes assumption makes spam filter naive Bayes model
For instance programmer assume P W Spam W P W Spam displaystyle P W_ mid text Spam land W_ P W_ mid text Spam finally obtain P Spam W W N P Spam n N P W n Spam displaystyle P text Spam land W_ land ldots land W_ N P text Spam prod _ n N P W_ n mid text Spam This kind assumption known naive Bayes assumption

The identification parameters could done either batch processing series classified e mails incremental updating parameters using user classifications e mails arrive
Both methods could combined system could start initial standard values parameters issued generic database incremental learning customizes classifier individual user
Question The question asked program probability given text spam knowing words appear appear text

A differentiable neural computer DNC memory augmented neural network architecture MANN typically definition recurrent implementation
The model published Alex Graves et al
DeepMind
Applications DNC indirectly takes inspiration Von Neumann architecture making likely outperform conventional architectures tasks fundamentally algorithmic cannot learned finding decision boundary
So far DNCs demonstrated handle relatively simple tasks solved using conventional programming
But DNCs need programmed problem instead trained
This attention span allows user feed complex data structures graphs sequentially recall later use
Furthermore learn aspects symbolic reasoning apply working memory
The researchers published method see promise DNCs trained perform complex structured tasks address big data applications require sort reasoning generating video commentaries semantic text analysis DNC trained navigate rapid transit systems apply network different system
A neural network without memory would typically learn transit system scratch
On graph traversal sequence processing tasks supervised learning DNCs performed better alternatives long short term memory neural turing machine
With reinforcement learning approach block puzzle problem inspired SHRDLU DNC trained via curriculum learning learned make plan
It performed better traditional recurrent neural network
Architecture DNC networks introduced extension Neural Turing Machine NTM addition memory attention mechanisms control memory stored temporal attention records order events
This structure allows DNCs robust abstract NTM still perform tasks longer term dependencies predecessors Long Short Term Memory LSTM
The memory simply matrix allocated dynamically accessed indefinitely
The DNC differentiable end end subcomponent model differentiable therefore whole model
This makes possible optimize efficiently using gradient descent The DNC model similar Von Neumann architecture resizability memory Turing complete
Traditional DNC DNC originally published Extensions Refinements include sparse memory addressing reduces time space complexity thousands times
This achieved using approximate nearest neighbor algorithm Locality sensitive hashing random k tree like Fast Library Approximate Nearest Neighbors UBC
Adding Adaptive Computation Time ACT separates computation time data time uses fact problem length problem difficulty always
Training using synthetic gradients performs considerably better Backpropagation time BPTT
Robustness improved use DNA normalization Bypass Dropout regularization

A chatbot piece software conducts conversation via auditory textual methods
Such programs often designed convincingly simulate human would behave conversational partner although far short able pass Turing test
Chatbots typically used dialog systems various practical purposes including customer service information acquisition
Some chatbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems many simpler ones scan keywords within input pull reply matching keywords similar wording pattern database
The term ChatterBot originally coined Michael Mauldin creator first Verbot Julia describe conversational programs
Today chatbots accessed via virtual assistants Google Assistant Amazon Alexa via messaging apps Facebook Messenger WeChat via individual organizations apps websites
Chatbots classified usage categories include conversational commerce e commerce via chat education entertainment finance health news productivity Beyond chatbots Conversational AI refers use messaging apps speech based assistants chatbots automate communication create personalized customer experiences scale
Background In Alan Turing famous article Computing Machinery Intelligence published proposed called Turing test criterion intelligence
This criterion depends ability computer program impersonate human real time written conversation human judge extent judge unable distinguish reliably basis conversational content alone program real human
The notoriety Turing proposed test stimulated great interest Joseph Weizenbaum program ELIZA published seemed able fool users believing conversing real human
However Weizenbaum claim ELIZA genuinely intelligent introduction paper presented debunking exercise In artificial intelligence machines made behave wondrous ways often sufficient dazzle even experienced observer
But particular program unmasked inner workings explained magic crumbles away stands revealed mere collection procedures
The observer says I could written
With thought moves program question shelf marked intelligent reserved curios
The object paper cause evaluation program explained
Few programs ever needed
ELIZA key method operation copied chatbot designers ever since involves recognition clue words phrases input output corresponding pre prepared pre programmed responses move conversation forward apparently meaningful way e g
responding input contains word MOTHER TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
Thus illusion understanding generated even though processing involved merely superficial
ELIZA showed illusion surprisingly easy generate human judges ready give benefit doubt conversational responses capable interpreted intelligent
Interface designers come appreciate humans readiness interpret computer output genuinely conversational even actually based rather simple pattern matching exploited useful purposes
Most people prefer engage programs human like gives chatbot style techniques potentially useful role interactive systems need elicit information users long information relatively straightforward falls predictable categories
Thus example online help systems usefully employ chatbot techniques identify area help users require potentially providing friendlier interface formal search menu system
This sort usage holds prospect moving chatbot technology Weizenbaum shelf reserved curios marked genuinely useful computational methods
Development Among notable early chatbots ELIZA PARRY
More recent notable programs include A L I C E Jabberwacky D U D E Agence Nationale de la Recherche CNRS
While ELIZA PARRY used exclusively simulate typed conversation many chatbots include functional features games web searching abilities
In book called The Policeman Beard Half Constructed published allegedly written chatbot Racter though program released would capable One pertinent field AI research natural language processing
Usually weak AI fields employ specialized software programming languages created specifically narrow function required
For example A L I C E
uses markup language called AIML specific function conversational agent since adopted various developers called Alicebots
Nevertheless A L I C E
still purely based pattern matching techniques without reasoning capabilities technique ELIZA using back
This strong AI would require sapience logical reasoning abilities
Jabberwacky learns new responses context based real time user interactions rather driven static database
Some recent chatbots also combine real time learning evolutionary algorithms optimise ability communicate based conversation held
Still currently general purpose conversational artificial intelligence software developers focus practical aspect information retrieval
Chatbot competitions focus Turing test specific goals
Two annual contests Loebner Prize The Chatterbox Challenge latter offline since however materials still found web archives DBpedia created chatbot GSoC communicate Facebook Messenger

They used B C customer service sales marketing In Facebook Messenger allowed developers place chatbots platform
There bots created Messenger first six months rising September Since September also part pilot program WhatsApp
Airlines KLM Aeroméxico announced participation testing airlines previously launched customer services Facebook Messenger platform
The bots usually appear one user contacts sometimes act participants group chat
Many banks insurers media companies e commerce companies airlines hotel chains retailers health care providers government entities restaurant chains used chatbots answer simple questions increase customer engagement promotion offer additional ways order A study showed companies used chatbots
According study businesses said intended one
As part company apps websites Previous generations chatbots present company websites e g
Ask Jenn Alaska Airlines debuted Expedia virtual customer service agent launched
The newer generation chatbots includes IBM Watson powered Rocky introduced February New York City based e commerce company Rare Carat provide information prospective diamond buyers
Chatbot sequences Used marketers script sequences messages similar Autoresponder sequence
Such sequences triggered user opt use keywords within user interactions
After trigger occurs sequence messages delivered next anticipated user response
Each user response used decision tree help chatbot navigate response sequences deliver correct response message
Company internal platforms Other companies explore ways use chatbots internally example Customer Support Human Resources even Internet Things IoT projects
Overstock com one reportedly launched chatbot named Mila automate certain simple yet time consuming processes requesting sick leave
Other large companies Lloyds Banking Group Royal Bank Scotland Renault Citroën using automated online assistants instead call centres humans provide first point contact
A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem steadily growing since F Conference Facebook Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Messenger would allow chatbots app
In large companies like hospitals aviation organizations IT architects designing reference architectures Intelligent Chatbots used unlock share knowledge experience organization efficiently reduce errors answers expert service desks significantly
These Intelligent Chatbots make use kinds artificial intelligence like image moderation natural language understanding NLU natural language generation NLG machine learning deep learning
Customer Service Many high tech banking organizations looking integrate automated AI based solutions chatbots customer service order provide faster cheaper assistance clients becoming increasingly comfortable technology
In particular chatbots efficiently conduct dialogue usually replacing communication tools email phone SMS
In banking major application related quick customer service answering common requests well transactional support
Several studies report significant reduction cost customer services expected lead billions dollars economic savings next years
In Gartner predicted customer service interactions globally handled completely AI
A study Juniper Research estimates retail sales resulting chatbot based interactions reach billion Since Facebook allowed businesses deliver automated customer support e commerce guidance content interactive experiences chatbots large variety chatbots developed Facebook Messenger platform In Russia based Tochka Bank launched world first Facebook bot range financial services including possibility making payments In July Barclays Africa also launched Facebook chatbot making first bank Africa The France third largest bank total assets Société Générale launched chatbot called SoBot March
While users SoBot expressed satisfaction tested Société Générale deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo stated never replace expertise provided human advisor
The advantages using chatbots customer interactions banking include cost reduction financial advice support
Healthcare Chatbots also appearing healthcare industry
A study suggested physicians United States believed chatbots would beneficial scheduling doctor appointments locating health clinics providing medication information Certain patient groups still reluctant use chatbots
A mixed methods study showed people still hesitant use chatbots healthcare due poor understanding technological complexity lack empathy concerns cyber security
The analysis showed heard health chatbot experience using perceived likely use one within months
The majority participants would use health chatbot seeking general health information booking medical appointment looking local health services
However health chatbot perceived less suitable seeking results medical tests seeking specialist advice sexual health
The analysis attitudinal variables showed participants reported preference discussing health doctors access reliable accurate health information
While curious new technologies could improve health reported seeking doctor experiencing health problem thought chatbot good idea
Interestingly reported dislike talking computers felt would strange discuss health matters chatbot half unsure could trust advice given chatbot
Therefore perceived trustworthiness individual attitudes towards bots dislike talking computers main barriers health chatbots
Politics In New Zealand chatbot SAM short Semantic Analysis Machine made Nick Gerritsen Touchtech developed
It designed share political thoughts example topics climate change healthcare education etc
It talks people Facebook Messenger
Toys Chatbots also incorporated devices primarily meant computing toys Hello Barbie Internet connected version doll uses chatbot provided company ToyTalk previously used chatbot range smartphone based characters children
These characters behaviors constrained set rules effect emulate particular character produce storyline IBM Watson computer used basis chatbot based educational toys companies CogniToys intended interact children educational purposes
Malicious use Malicious chatbots frequently used fill chat rooms spam advertisements mimicking human behavior conversations entice people revealing personal information bank account numbers
They commonly found Yahoo
Messenger Windows Live Messenger AOL Instant Messenger instant messaging protocols
There also published report chatbot used fake personal ad dating service website Tay AI chatbot learns previous interaction caused major controversy due targeted internet trolls Twitter
The bot exploited hours began send extremely offensive Tweets users
This suggests although bot learnt effectively experience adequate protection put place prevent misuse If text sending algorithm pass human instead chatbot message would credible
Therefore human seeming chatbots well crafted online identities could start scattering fake news seem plausible instance making false claims presidential election
With enough chatbots might even possible achieve artificial social proof
Limitations Chatbots The creation implementation chatbots still developing area heavily related artificial intelligence machine learning provided solutions possessing obvious advantages important limitations terms functionalities use cases
However changing time
The common ones listed As database used output generation fixed limited chatbots fail dealing unsaved query
A chatbot efficiency highly depends language processing limited irregularities accents mistakes create important barrier international multi cultural organisations Chatbots unable deal multiple questions time conversation opportunities limited
As happens usually technology led changes existing services consumers often old generation uncomfortable chatbots due limited understanding making obvious requests dealt machines
Chatbots jobs Chatbots increasingly present businesses often used automate tasks require skill based talents
With customer service taking place via messaging apps well phone calls growing numbers use cases chatbot deployment gives organisations clear return investment
Call centre workers may particularly risk AI driven chatbots A study Forrester June predicts today jobs likely impacted AI technologies

Their predictions inspiration Stanley Kubrick Arthur C Clarke character HAL embodied AI researchers believed could create year
AI pioneer Marvin Minsky consultant project making HAL realistic possible according consensus predictions time Crevier quotes said subject Within generation problem creating artificial intelligence substantially solved although Minsky states misquoted However early became obvious researchers grossly underestimated difficulty project
Funding agencies became skeptical AGI put researchers increasing pressure produce useful applied AI
As began Japan Fifth Generation Computer Project revived interest AGI setting ten year timeline included AGI goals like carry casual conversation
In response success expert systems industry government pumped money back field
However confidence AI spectacularly collapsed late goals Fifth Generation Computer Project never fulfilled
For second time years AI researchers predicted imminent achievement AGI shown fundamentally mistaken
By AI researchers gained reputation making vain promises
They became reluctant make predictions avoid mention human level artificial intelligence fear labeled wild eyed dreamer
Narrow AI research In early st century mainstream AI achieved far greater commercial success academic respectability focusing specific sub problems produce verifiable results commercial applications artificial neural networks computer vision data mining
These applied AI systems used extensively throughout technology industry research vein heavily funded academia industry
Currently development field considered emerging trend mature stage expected happen years
Most mainstream AI researchers hope strong AI developed combining programs solve various sub problems using integrated agent architecture cognitive architecture subsumption architecture
Hans Moravec wrote I confident bottom route artificial intelligence one day meet traditional top route half way ready provide real world competence commonsense knowledge frustratingly elusive reasoning programs
Fully intelligent machines result metaphorical golden spike driven uniting two efforts
However even fundamental philosophy disputed example Stevan Harnad Princeton concluded paper Symbol Grounding Hypothesis stating The expectation often voiced top symbolic approaches modeling cognition somehow meet bottom sensory approaches somewhere
If grounding considerations paper valid expectation hopelessly modular really one viable route sense symbols ground
A free floating symbolic level like software level computer never reached route vice versa clear even try reach level since looks getting would amount uprooting symbols intrinsic meanings thereby merely reducing functional equivalent programmable computer
Modern artificial general intelligence research Artificial general intelligence AGI describes research aims create machines capable general intelligent action
The term used early Mark Gubrud discussion implications fully automated military production operations
The term introduced popularized Shane Legg Ben Goertzel around
The research objective much older example Doug Lenat Cyc project began Allen Newell Soar project regarded within scope AGI

Whole brain emulation discussed computational neuroscience neuroinformatics context brain simulation medical research purposes
It discussed artificial intelligence research approach strong AI
Neuroimaging technologies could deliver necessary detailed understanding improving rapidly futurist Ray Kurzweil book The Singularity Is Near predicts map sufficient quality become available similar timescale required computing power
Early estimates For low level brain simulation extremely powerful computer would required
The human brain huge number synapses
Each one hundred billion neurons average synaptic connections synapses neurons
It estimated brain three year old child synapses quadrillion
This number declines age stabilizing adulthood
Estimates vary adult ranging synapses trillion
An estimate brain processing power based simple switch model neuron activity around trillion synaptic updates per second SUPS
In Kurzweil looked various estimates hardware required equal human brain adopted figure computations per second cps
For comparison computation equivalent one floating point operation measure used rate current supercomputers computations would equivalent petaFLOPS achieved
He used figure predict necessary hardware would available sometime exponential growth computer power time writing continued
Modelling neurons detail The artificial neuron model assumed Kurzweil used many current artificial neural network implementations simple compared biological neurons
A brain simulation would likely capture detailed cellular behaviour biological neurons presently understood broadest outlines
The overhead introduced full modeling biological chemical physical details neural behaviour especially molecular scale would require computational powers several orders magnitude larger Kurzweil estimate
In addition estimates account glial cells least numerous neurons may outnumber neurons much known play role cognitive processes
Current research There research projects investigating brain simulation using sophisticated neural models implemented conventional computing architectures
The Artificial Intelligence System project implemented non real time simulations brain neurons
It took days cluster processors simulate second model
The Blue Brain project used one fastest supercomputer architectures world IBM Blue Gene platform create real time simulation single rat neocortical column consisting approximately neurons synapses

He measured ability existing software simulate functionality neural tissue specifically retina
His results depend number glial cells kinds processing neurons perform
The actual complexity modeling biological neurons explored OpenWorm project aimed complete simulation worm neurons neural network among cells total
The animal neural network well documented start project
However although task seemed simple beginning models based generic neural network work
Currently efforts focused precise emulation biological neurons partly molecular level result called total success yet
Even number issues solved human brain scale model proportional number neurons amount work along path obvious
Criticisms simulation based approaches A fundamental criticism simulated brain approach derives embodied cognition human embodiment taken essential aspect human intelligence
Many researchers believe embodiment necessary ground meaning
If view correct fully functional brain model need encompass neurons e robotic body
Goertzel proposes virtual embodiment like Second Life yet known whether would sufficient
Desktop computers using microprocessors capable cps Kurzweil non standard unit computations per second see available since
According brain power estimates used Kurzweil Moravec computer capable supporting simulation bee brain despite interest simulation exists
There least three reasons The neuron model seems oversimplified see next section
There insufficient understanding higher cognitive processes establish accurately brain neural activity observed using techniques functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates
Even understanding cognition advances sufficiently early simulation programs likely inefficient therefore need considerably hardware
The brain organism critical may appropriate boundary cognitive model
To simulate bee brain may necessary simulate body environment
The Extended Mind thesis formalizes philosophical concept research cephalopods demonstrated clear examples decentralized system In addition scale human brain currently well constrained
One estimate puts human brain billion neurons trillion synapses
Another estimate billion neurons billion cerebral cortex billion cerebellum
Glial cell synapses currently unquantified known extremely numerous
Strong AI consciousness In philosopher John Searle coined term strong AI part Chinese room argument
He wanted distinguish two different hypotheses artificial intelligence An artificial intelligence system think mind
The word mind specific meaning philosophers used mind body problem philosophy mind
An artificial intelligence system act like thinks mind The first one called strong AI hypothesis second weak AI hypothesis first one makes stronger statement assumes something special happened machine goes beyond abilities test
Searle referred strong AI hypothesis strong AI
This usage also common academic AI research textbooks The weak AI hypothesis equivalent hypothesis artificial general intelligence possible
According Russell Norvig Most AI researchers take weak AI hypothesis granted care strong AI hypothesis
In contrast Searle Ray Kurzweil uses term strong AI describe artificial intelligence system acts like mind regardless whether philosopher would able determine actually mind
In science fiction AGI associated traits consciousness sentience sapience self awareness observed living beings
However according Searle open question whether general intelligence sufficient consciousness
Strong AI defined Kurzweil confused Searle strong AI hypothesis
The strong AI hypothesis claim computer behaves intelligently person must also necessarily mind consciousness
AGI refers amount intelligence machine displays without mind
Consciousness There aspects human mind besides intelligence relevant concept strong AI play major role science fiction ethics artificial intelligence consciousness To subjective experience thought
self awareness To aware oneself separate individual especially aware one thoughts
sentience The ability feel perceptions emotions subjectively
sapience The capacity wisdom These traits moral dimension machine form strong AI may legal rights analogous rights non human animals
Also Bill Joy among others argues machine traits may threat human life dignity
It remains shown whether traits necessary strong AI
The role consciousness clear currently agreed test presence
If machine built device simulates neural correlates consciousness would automatically self awareness
It also possible properties sentience naturally emerge fully intelligent machine becomes natural ascribe properties machines begin act way clearly intelligent
For example intelligent action may sufficient sentience rather way around
Artificial consciousness research Although role consciousness strong AI AGI debatable many AGI researchers regard research investigates possibilities implementing consciousness vital
In early effort Igor Aleksander argued principles creating conscious machine already existed would take forty years train machine understand language
Possible explanations slow progress AI research Since launch AI research growth field slowed time stalled aims creating machines skilled intelligent action human level
A possible explanation delay computers lack sufficient scope memory processing power
In addition level complexity connects process AI research may also limit progress AI research While AI researchers believe strong AI achieved future individuals like Hubert Dreyfus Roger Penrose deny possibility achieving strong AI
John McCarthy one various computer scientists believe human level AI accomplished date cannot accurately predicted Conceptual limitations another possible reason slowness AI research
AI researchers may need modify conceptual framework discipline order provide stronger base contribution quest achieving strong AI
As William Clocksin wrote framework starts Weizenbaum observation intelligence manifests relative specific social cultural contexts Furthermore AI researchers able create computers perform jobs complicated people conversely struggled develop computer capable carrying tasks simple humans Moravec paradox
A problem described David Gelernter people assume thinking reasoning equivalent
However idea whether thoughts creator thoughts isolated individually intrigued AI researchers The problems encountered AI research past decades impeded progress AI
The failed predictions promised AI researchers lack complete understanding human behaviors helped diminish primary idea human level AI
Although progress AI research brought improvement disappointment investigators established optimism potentially achieving goal AI st century Other possible reasons proposed lengthy research progress strong AI
The intricacy scientific problems need fully understand human brain psychology neurophysiology limited many researchers emulating function human brain computer hardware
Many researchers tend underestimate doubt involved future predictions AI without taking issues seriously people overlook solutions problematic questions Clocksin says conceptual limitation may impede progress AI research people may using wrong techniques computer programs implementation equipment
When AI researchers first began aim goal artificial intelligence main interest human reasoning
Researchers hoped establish computational models human knowledge reasoning find design computer specific cognitive task The practice abstraction people tend redefine working particular context research provides researchers concentration concepts
The productive use abstraction AI research comes planning problem solving
Although aim increase speed computation role abstraction posed questions involvement abstraction operators A possible reason slowness AI relates acknowledgement many AI researchers heuristics section contains significant breach computer performance human performance
The specific functions programmed computer may able account many requirements allow match human intelligence
These explanations necessarily guaranteed fundamental causes delay achieving strong AI widely agreed numerous researchers
There many AI researchers debate idea whether machines created emotions
There emotions typical models AI researchers say programming emotions machines allows mind
Emotion sums experiences humans allows remember experiences
David Gelernter writes No computer creative unless simulate nuances human emotion
This concern emotion posed problems AI researchers connects concept strong AI research progresses future
Controversies dangers Feasibility Opinions vary whether artificial general intelligence arrive
At one extreme AI pioneer Herbert A Simon wrote machines capable within twenty years work man
However prediction failed come true
Microsoft co founder Paul Allen believed intelligence unlikely st century would require unforeseeable fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs scientifically deep understanding cognition
Writing The Guardian roboticist Alan Winfield claimed gulf modern computing human level artificial intelligence wide gulf current space flight practical faster light spaceflight
AI experts views feasibility AGI wax wane may seen resurgence
Four polls conducted suggested median guess among experts confident AGI would arrive depending poll mean
It also interesting note experts answered never asked question confidence instead
Further current AGI progress considerations found Tests confirming human level AGI IQ tests AGI
Potential threat human existence The thesis AI poses existential risk risk needs much attention currently gets endorsed many public figures perhaps famous Elon Musk Bill Gates Stephen Hawking
The notable AI researcher endorse thesis Stuart J Russell
Endorsers thesis sometimes express bafflement skeptics Gates states understand people concerned Hawking criticized widespread indifference editorial Many scholars concerned existential risk believe best way forward would conduct possibly massive research solving difficult control problem answer question types safeguards algorithms architectures programmers implement maximize probability recursively improving AI would continue behave friendly rather destructive manner reaches superintelligence The thesis AI pose existential risk also many strong detractors
Skeptics sometimes charge thesis crypto religious irrational belief possibility superintelligence replacing irrational belief omnipotent God extreme Jaron Lanier argues whole concept current machines way intelligent illusion stupendous con wealthy Much existing criticism argues AGI unlikely short term computer scientist Gordon Bell argues human race already destroy reaches technological singularity
Gordon Moore original proponent Moore Law declares I skeptic
I believe technological singularity likely happen least long time
And I know I feel way
Baidu Vice President Andrew Ng states AI existential risk like worrying overpopulation Mars even set foot planet yet

A hierarchical control system HCS form control system set devices governing software arranged hierarchical tree
When links tree implemented computer network hierarchical control system also form networked control system
Overview A human built system complex behavior often organized hierarchy
For example command hierarchy among notable features organizational chart superiors subordinates lines organizational communication
Hierarchical control systems organized similarly divide decision making responsibility
Each element hierarchy linked node tree
Commands tasks goals achieved flow tree superior nodes subordinate nodes whereas sensations command results flow tree subordinate superior nodes
Nodes may also exchange messages siblings
The two distinguishing features hierarchical control system related layers
Each higher layer tree operates longer interval planning execution time immediately lower layer
The lower layers local tasks goals sensations activities planned coordinated higher layers generally override decisions
The layers form hybrid intelligent system lowest reactive layers sub symbolic
The higher layers relaxed time constraints capable reasoning abstract world model performing planning
A hierarchical task network good fit planning hierarchical control system Besides artificial systems animal control systems proposed organized hierarchy
In perceptual control theory postulates organism behavior means controlling perceptions organism control systems suggested organized hierarchical pattern perceptions constructed
Control system structure The accompanying diagram general hierarchical model shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control industrial control system

James Albus NIST developed theory intelligent system design named Reference Model Architecture RMA hierarchical control system inspired RCS
Albus defines node contain components
Behavior generation responsible executing tasks received superior parent node
It also plans issues tasks subordinate nodes
Sensory perception responsible receiving sensations subordinate nodes grouping filtering otherwise processing higher level abstractions update local state form sensations sent superior node
Value judgment responsible evaluating updated situation evaluating alternative plans
World Model local state provides model controlled system controlled process environment abstraction level subordinate nodes At lowest levels RMA implemented subsumption architecture world model mapped directly controlled process real world avoiding need mathematical abstraction time constrained reactive planning implemented finite state machine
Higher levels RMA however may sophisticated mathematical world models behavior implemented automated planning scheduling
Planning required certain behaviors cannot triggered current sensations rather predicted anticipated sensations especially come result node actions

Game theory study mathematical models strategic interaction among rational decision makers
It applications fields social science well logic systems science computer science
Originally addressed zero sum games participant gains losses exactly balanced participants
Today game theory applies wide range behavioral relations umbrella term science logical decision making humans animals computers
Modern game theory began idea mixed strategy equilibria two person zero sum games proof John von Neumann
Von Neumann original proof used Brouwer fixed point theorem continuous mappings compact convex sets became standard method game theory mathematical economics
His paper followed book Theory Games Economic Behavior co written Oskar Morgenstern considered cooperative games several players
The second edition book provided axiomatic theory expected utility allowed mathematical statisticians economists treat decision making uncertainty
Game theory developed extensively many scholars
It explicitly applied biology although similar developments go back least far
Game theory widely recognized important tool many fields
As Nobel Memorial Prize Economic Sciences going game theorist Jean Tirole eleven game theorists economics Nobel Prize
John Maynard Smith awarded Crafoord Prize application game theory biology
History Discussions two person games began long rise modern mathematical game theory
The first known discussion game theory occurred letter believed written Charles Waldegrave active Jacobite uncle James Waldegrave British diplomat
The true identity original correspondent somewhat elusive given limited details evidence available subjective nature interpretation
One theory postulates Francis Waldegrave true correspondent yet proven
In letter Waldegrave provides minimax mixed strategy solution two person version card game le Her problem known Waldegrave problem
In Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses Researches Mathematical Principles Theory Wealth Antoine Augustin Cournot considered duopoly presents solution Nash equilibrium game
In Ernst Zermelo published Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels On Application Set Theory Theory Game Chess proved optimal chess strategy strictly determined
This paved way general theorems In Danish mathematical economist Frederik Zeuthen proved mathematical model winning strategy using Brouwer fixed point theorem
In book Applications aux Jeux de Hasard earlier notes Émile Borel proved minimax theorem two person zero sum matrix games pay matrix symmetric provides solution non trivial infinite game known English Blotto game
Borel conjectured non existence mixed strategy equilibria finite two person zero sum games conjecture proved false von Neumann
Game theory really exist unique field John von Neumann published paper On Theory Games Strategy
Von Neumann original proof used Brouwer fixed point theorem continuous mappings compact convex sets became standard method game theory mathematical economics
His paper followed book Theory Games Economic Behavior co authored Oskar Morgenstern
The second edition book provided axiomatic theory utility reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli old theory utility money independent discipline
Von Neumann work game theory culminated book
This foundational work contains method finding mutually consistent solutions two person zero sum games
Subsequent work focused primarily cooperative game theory analyzes optimal strategies groups individuals presuming enforce agreements proper strategies In first mathematical discussion prisoner dilemma appeared experiment undertaken notable mathematicians Merrill M Flood Melvin Dresher part RAND Corporation investigations game theory
RAND pursued studies possible applications global nuclear strategy
Around time John Nash developed criterion mutual consistency players strategies known Nash equilibrium applicable wider variety games criterion proposed von Neumann Morgenstern
Nash proved every finite n player non zero sum player zero sum non cooperative game known Nash equilibrium mixed strategies
Game theory experienced flurry activity concepts core extensive form game fictitious play repeated games Shapley value developed
The also saw first applications game theory philosophy political science
In Robert Axelrod tried setting computer programs players found tournaments winner often simple tit tat program cooperates first step subsequent steps whatever opponent previous step
The winner also often obtained natural selection fact widely taken explain cooperation phenomena evolutionary biology social sciences
Prize winning achievements In Reinhard Selten introduced solution concept subgame perfect equilibria refined Nash equilibrium
Later would introduce trembling hand perfection well
In Nash Selten Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates contributions economic game theory
In game theory extensively applied biology largely result work John Maynard Smith evolutionarily stable strategy
In addition concepts correlated equilibrium trembling hand perfection common knowledge introduced analyzed
In game theorists Thomas Schelling Robert Aumann followed Nash Selten Harsanyi Nobel Laureates
Schelling worked dynamic models early examples evolutionary game theory
Aumann contributed equilibrium school introducing equilibrium coarsening correlated equilibria developing extensive formal analysis assumption common knowledge consequences
In Leonid Hurwicz Eric Maskin Roger Myerson awarded Nobel Prize Economics laid foundations mechanism design theory
Myerson contributions include notion proper equilibrium important graduate text Game Theory Analysis Conflict
Hurwicz introduced formalized concept incentive compatibility
In Alvin E Roth Lloyd S Shapley awarded Nobel Prize Economics theory stable allocations practice market design
In Nobel went game theorist Jean Tirole
Game types Cooperative non cooperative A game cooperative players able form binding commitments externally enforced e g
contract law
A game non cooperative players cannot form alliances agreements need self enforcing e g
credible threats
Cooperative games often analyzed framework cooperative game theory focuses predicting coalitions form joint actions groups take resulting collective payoffs
It opposed traditional non cooperative game theory focuses predicting individual players actions payoffs analyzing Nash equilibria
Cooperative game theory provides high level approach describes structure strategies payoffs coalitions whereas non cooperative game theory also looks bargaining procedures affect distribution payoffs within coalition
As non cooperative game theory general cooperative games analyzed approach non cooperative game theory converse hold provided sufficient assumptions made encompass possible strategies available players due possibility external enforcement cooperation
While would thus optimal games expressed non cooperative framework many instances insufficient information available accurately model formal procedures available strategic bargaining process resulting model would complex offer practical tool real world
In cases cooperative game theory provides simplified approach allows analysis game large without make assumption bargaining powers
Symmetric asymmetric A symmetric game game payoffs playing particular strategy depend strategies employed playing
That identities players changed without changing payoff strategies game symmetric
Many commonly studied games symmetric
The standard representations chicken prisoner dilemma stag hunt symmetric games
Some scholars would consider certain asymmetric games examples games well
However common payoffs games symmetric
Most commonly studied asymmetric games games identical strategy sets players
For instance ultimatum game similarly dictator game different strategies player
It possible however game identical strategies players yet asymmetric
For example game pictured right asymmetric despite identical strategy sets players
Zero sum non zero sum Zero sum games special case constant sum games choices players neither increase decrease available resources
In zero sum games total benefit players game every combination strategies always adds zero informally player benefits equal expense others
Poker exemplifies zero sum game ignoring possibility house cut one wins exactly amount one opponents lose
Other zero sum games include matching pennies classical board games including Go chess
Many games studied game theorists including famed prisoner dilemma non zero sum games outcome net results greater less zero
Informally non zero sum games gain one player necessarily correspond loss another
Constant sum games correspond activities like theft gambling fundamental economic situation potential gains trade
It possible transform game possibly asymmetric zero sum game adding dummy player often called board whose losses compensate players net winnings
Simultaneous sequential Simultaneous games games players move simultaneously move simultaneously later players unaware earlier players actions making effectively simultaneous
Sequential games dynamic games games later players knowledge earlier actions
This need perfect information every action earlier players might little knowledge
For instance player may know earlier player perform one particular action know available actions first player actually performed
The difference simultaneous sequential games captured different representations discussed
Often normal form used represent simultaneous games extensive form used represent sequential ones
The transformation extensive normal form one way meaning multiple extensive form games correspond normal form
Consequently notions equilibrium simultaneous games insufficient reasoning sequential games see subgame perfection
In short differences sequential simultaneous games follows Perfect information imperfect information An important subset sequential games consists games perfect information
A game one perfect information players know moves previously made players
Most games studied game theory imperfect information games
Examples perfect information games include tic tac toe checkers infinite chess Go Many card games games imperfect information poker bridge
Perfect information often confused complete information similar concept
Complete information requires every player know strategies payoffs available players necessarily actions taken
Games incomplete information reduced however games imperfect information introducing moves nature
Combinatorial games Games difficulty finding optimal strategy stems multiplicity possible moves called combinatorial games
Examples include chess go
Games involve imperfect information may also strong combinatorial character instance backgammon
There unified theory addressing combinatorial elements games
There however mathematical tools solve particular problems answer general questions Games perfect information studied combinatorial game theory developed novel representations e g
surreal numbers well combinatorial algebraic sometimes non constructive proof methods solve games certain types including loopy games may result infinitely long sequences moves
These methods address games higher combinatorial complexity usually considered traditional economic game theory
A typical game solved way hex
A related field study drawing computational complexity theory game complexity concerned estimating computational difficulty finding optimal strategies Research artificial intelligence addressed perfect imperfect information games complex combinatorial structures like chess go backgammon provable optimal strategies found
The practical solutions involve computational heuristics like alpha beta pruning use artificial neural networks trained reinforcement learning make games tractable computing practice
Infinitely long games Games studied economists real world game players generally finished finitely many moves
Pure mathematicians constrained set theorists particular study games last infinitely many moves winner payoff known moves completed
The focus attention usually much best way play game whether one player winning strategy
It proven using axiom choice games even perfect information outcomes win lose neither player winning strategy
The existence strategies cleverly designed games important consequences descriptive set theory
Discrete continuous games Much game theory concerned finite discrete games finite number players moves events outcomes etc
Many concepts extended however
Continuous games allow players choose strategy continuous strategy set
For instance Cournot competition typically modeled players strategies non negative quantities including fractional quantities
Differential games Differential games continuous pursuit evasion game continuous games evolution players state variables governed differential equations
The problem finding optimal strategy differential game closely related optimal control theory
In particular two types strategies open loop strategies found using Pontryagin maximum principle closed loop strategies found using Bellman Dynamic Programming method
A particular case differential games games random time horizon
In games terminal time random variable given probability distribution function
Therefore players maximize mathematical expectation cost function
It shown modified optimization problem reformulated discounted differential game infinite time interval
Evolutionary game theory Evolutionary game theory studies players adjust strategies time according rules necessarily rational farsighted
In general evolution strategies time according rules modeled Markov chain state variable current strategy profile game played recent past
Such rules may feature imitation optimization survival fittest
In biology models represent biological evolution offspring adopt parents strategies parents play successful strategies e
corresponding higher payoffs greater number offspring
In social sciences models typically represent strategic adjustment players play game many times within lifetime consciously unconsciously occasionally adjust strategies
Stochastic outcomes relation fields Individual decision problems stochastic outcomes sometimes considered one player games
These situations considered game theoretical authors
They may modeled using similar tools within related disciplines decision theory operations research areas artificial intelligence particularly AI planning uncertainty multi agent system
Although fields may different motivators mathematics involved substantially e g
using Markov decision processes MDP Stochastic outcomes also modeled terms game theory adding randomly acting player makes chance moves moves nature
This player typically considered third player otherwise two player game merely serves provide roll dice required game
For problems different approaches modeling stochastic outcomes may lead different solutions
For example difference approach MDPs minimax solution latter considers worst case set adversarial moves rather reasoning expectation moves given fixed probability distribution
The minimax approach may advantageous stochastic models uncertainty available may also overestimating extremely unlikely costly events dramatically swaying strategy scenarios assumed adversary force event happen
See Black swan theory discussion kind modeling issue particularly relates predicting limiting losses investment banking
General models include elements stochastic outcomes adversaries partial noisy observability moves players also studied
The gold standard considered partially observable stochastic game POSG realistic problems computationally feasible POSG representation
Metagames These games play development rules another game target subject game
Metagames seek maximize utility value rule set developed
The theory metagames related mechanism design theory
The term metagame analysis also used refer practical approach developed Nigel Howard
whereby situation framed strategic game stakeholders try realize objectives means options available
Subsequent developments led formulation confrontation analysis
Pooling games These games prevailing forms society
Pooling games repeated plays changing payoff table general experienced path equilibrium strategies usually take form evolutionary social convention economic convention
Pooling game theory emerges formally recognize interaction optimal choice one play emergence forthcoming payoff table update path identify invariance existence robustness predict variance time
The theory based upon topological transformation classification payoff table update time predict variance invariance also within jurisdiction computational law reachable optimality ordered system
Mean field game theory Mean field game theory study strategic decision making large populations small interacting agents
This class problems considered economics literature Boyan Jovanovic Robert W Rosenthal engineering literature Peter E Caines mathematician Pierre Louis Lions Jean Michel Lasry
Representation games The games studied game theory well defined mathematical objects
To fully defined game must specify following elements players game information actions available player decision point payoffs outcome
Eric Rasmusen refers four essential elements acronym PAPI
A game theorist typically uses elements along solution concept choosing deduce set equilibrium strategies player strategies employed player profit unilaterally deviating strategy
These equilibrium strategies determine equilibrium game stable state either one outcome occurs set outcomes occur known probability
Most cooperative games presented characteristic function form extensive normal forms used define noncooperative games
Extensive form The extensive form used formalize games time sequencing moves
Games played trees pictured
Here vertex node represents point choice player
The player specified number listed vertex
The lines vertex represent possible action player
The payoffs specified bottom tree
The extensive form viewed multi player generalization decision tree
To solve extensive form game backward induction must used
It involves working backward game tree determine rational player would last vertex tree player previous move would given player last move rational first vertex tree reached The game pictured consists two players
The way particular game structured e sequential decision making perfect information Player moves first choosing either F U Fair Unfair
Next sequence Player seen Player move chooses play either A R Once Player made choice game considered finished player gets respective payoff
Suppose Player chooses U Player chooses A Player gets payoff eight real world terms interpreted many ways simplest terms money could mean things eight days vacation eight countries conquered even eight opportunities play game players Player gets payoff two
The extensive form also capture simultaneous move games games imperfect information
To represent either dotted line connects different vertices represent part information set e
players know point closed line drawn around
See example imperfect information section
Normal form The normal strategic form game usually represented matrix shows players strategies payoffs see example right
More generally represented function associates payoff player every possible combination actions
In accompanying example two players one chooses row chooses column
Each player two strategies specified number rows number columns
The payoffs provided interior
The first number payoff received row player Player example second payoff column player Player example
Suppose Player plays Up Player plays Left
Then Player gets payoff Player gets
When game presented normal form presumed player acts simultaneously least without knowing actions
If players information choices players game usually presented extensive form
Every extensive form game equivalent normal form game however transformation normal form may result exponential blowup size representation making computationally impractical
Characteristic function form In games possess removable utility separate rewards given rather characteristic function decides payoff unity
The idea unity empty speak receive reward
The origin form found John von Neumann Oskar Morgenstern book looking instances guessed union C displaystyle mathbf C appears works fraction N C displaystyle left frac mathbf N mathbf C right two individuals playing normal game
The balanced payoff C basic function
Although differing examples help determine coalitional amounts normal games appear function form derived
Formally characteristic function seen N v N represents group people v N R displaystyle v N mathbf R normal utility
Such characteristic functions expanded describe games removable utility
Alternative game representations Alternative game representation forms exist used subclasses games adjusted needs interdisciplinary research
In addition classical game representions alternative representations also encode time related aspects
General applied uses As method applied mathematics game theory used study wide variety human animal behaviors
It initially developed economics understand large collection economic behaviors including behaviors firms markets consumers
The first use game theoretic analysis Antoine Augustin Cournot solution Cournot duopoly
The use game theory social sciences expanded game theory applied political sociological psychological behaviors well
Although pre twentieth century naturalists Charles Darwin made game theoretic kinds statements use game theoretic analysis biology began Ronald Fisher studies animal behavior
This work predates name game theory shares many important features field
The developments economics later applied biology largely John Maynard Smith book Evolution Theory Games In addition used describe predict explain behavior game theory also used develop theories ethical normative behavior prescribe behavior
In economics philosophy scholars applied game theory help understanding good proper behavior
Game theoretic arguments type found far back Plato
An alternative version game theory called chemical game theory represents player choices metaphorical chemical reactant molecules called knowlecules
Chemical game theory calculates outcomes equilibrium solutions system chemical reactions
Description modeling The primary use game theory describe model human populations behave
Some scholars believe finding equilibria games predict actual human populations behave confronted situations analogous game studied
This particular view game theory criticized
It argued assumptions made game theorists often violated applied real world situations
Game theorists usually assume players act rationally practice human behavior often deviates model
Game theorists respond comparing assumptions used physics
Thus assumptions always hold treat game theory reasonable scientific ideal akin models used physicists
However empirical work shown classic games centipede game guess average game dictator game people regularly play Nash equilibria
There ongoing debate regarding importance experiments whether analysis experiments fully captures aspects relevant situation Some game theorists following work John Maynard Smith George R Price turned evolutionary game theory order resolve issues
These models presume either rationality bounded rationality part players
Despite name evolutionary game theory necessarily presume natural selection biological sense
Evolutionary game theory includes biological well cultural evolution also models individual learning example fictitious play dynamics
Prescriptive normative analysis Some scholars see game theory predictive tool behavior human beings suggestion people ought behave
Since strategy corresponding Nash equilibrium game constitutes one best response actions players provided Nash equilibrium playing strategy part Nash equilibrium seems appropriate
This normative use game theory also come criticism
Economics business Game theory major method used mathematical economics business modeling competing behaviors interacting agents
Applications include wide array economic phenomena approaches auctions bargaining mergers acquisitions pricing fair division duopolies oligopolies social network formation agent based computational economics general equilibrium mechanism design voting systems across broad areas experimental economics behavioral economics information economics industrial organization political economy This research usually focuses particular sets strategies known solution concepts equilibria
A common assumption players act rationally
In non cooperative games famous Nash equilibrium
A set strategies Nash equilibrium represents best response strategies
If players playing strategies Nash equilibrium unilateral incentive deviate since strategy best given others The payoffs game generally taken represent utility individual players
A prototypical paper game theory economics begins presenting game abstraction particular economic situation
One solution concepts chosen author demonstrates strategy sets presented game equilibria appropriate type
Naturally one might wonder use information put
Economists business professors suggest two primary uses noted descriptive prescriptive
Project Management Sensible decision making critical success projects
In project management game theory used model decision making process players investors project managers contractors sub contractors governments customers
Quite often players competing interests sometimes interests directly detrimental players making project management scenarios well suited modeled game theory
Piraveenan review provides several examples game theory used model project management scenarios
For instance investor typically several investment options option likely result different project thus one investment options chosen project charter produced
Similarly large project involving subcontractors instance construction project complex interplay main contractor project manager subcontractors among subcontractors typically several decision points
For example ambiguity contract contractor subcontractor must decide hard push case without jeopardizing whole project thus stake
Similarly projects competing organizations launched marketing personnel decide best timing strategy market project resultant product service gain maximum traction face competition
In scenarios required decisions depend decisions players way competing interests interests decision maker thus ideally modeled using game theory
Piraveenan summarises two player games predominantly used model project management scenarios based identity players five distinct types games used project management
Government sector private sector games games model Public Private Partnerships Contractor contractor games Contractor subcontractor games Subcontractor subcontractor games Games involving playersIn terms types games cooperative well non cooperative games normal form well extensive form games zero sum well non zero sum games used model various project management scenarios
Political science The application game theory political science focused overlapping areas fair division political economy public choice war bargaining positive political theory social choice theory
In areas researchers developed game theoretic models players often voters states special interest groups politicians
Early examples game theory applied political science provided Anthony Downs
In book An Economic Theory Democracy applies Hotelling firm location model political process
In Downsian model political candidates commit ideologies one dimensional policy space
Downs first shows political candidates converge ideology preferred median voter voters fully informed argues voters choose remain rationally ignorant allows candidate divergence
Game Theory applied Cuban missile crisis presidency John F Kennedy It also proposed game theory explains stability form political government
Taking simplest case monarchy example king one person cannot maintain authority personally exercising physical control even significant number subjects
Sovereign control instead explained recognition citizen citizens expect view king established government person whose orders followed
Coordinating communication among citizens replace sovereign effectively barred since conspiracy replace sovereign generally punishable crime
Thus process modeled variants prisoner dilemma periods stability citizen find rational move replace sovereign even citizens know would better act collectively A game theoretic explanation democratic peace public open debate democracies sends clear reliable information regarding intentions states
In contrast difficult know intentions nondemocratic leaders effect concessions promises kept
Thus mistrust unwillingness make concessions least one parties dispute non democracy On hand game theory predicts two countries may still go war even leaders cognizant costs fighting
War may result asymmetric information two countries may incentives mis represent amount military resources hand rendering unable settle disputes agreeably without resorting fighting
Moreover war may arise commitment problems two countries wish settle dispute via peaceful means wishes go back terms settlement may choice resort warfare
Finally war may result issue indivisibilities Game theory could also help predict nation responses new rule law applied nation
One example would Peter John Wood research looked nations could help reduce climate change
Wood thought could accomplished making treaties nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions
However concluded idea could work would create prisoner dilemma nations
Biology Unlike economics payoffs games biology often interpreted corresponding fitness
In addition focus less equilibria correspond notion rationality ones would maintained evolutionary forces
The best known equilibrium biology known evolutionarily stable strategy ESS first introduced Smith Price
Although initial motivation involve mental requirements Nash equilibrium every ESS Nash equilibrium
In biology game theory used model understand many different phenomena
It first used explain evolution stability approximate sex ratios
Fisher suggested sex ratios result evolutionary forces acting individuals could seen trying maximize number grandchildren
Additionally biologists used evolutionary game theory ESS explain emergence animal communication
The analysis signaling games communication games provided insight evolution communication among animals
For example mobbing behavior many species large number prey animals attack larger predator seems example spontaneous emergent organization
Ants also shown exhibit feed forward behavior akin fashion see Paul Ormerod Butterfly Economics
Biologists used game chicken analyze fighting behavior territoriality According Maynard Smith preface Evolution Theory Games paradoxically turned game theory readily applied biology field economic behaviour originally designed
Evolutionary game theory used explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena nature One phenomenon known biological altruism
This situation organism appears act way benefits organisms detrimental
This distinct traditional notions altruism actions conscious appear evolutionary adaptations increase overall fitness
Examples found species ranging vampire bats regurgitate blood obtained night hunting give group members failed feed worker bees care queen bee entire lives never mate vervet monkeys warn group members predator approach even endangers individual chance survival
All actions increase overall fitness group occur cost individual
Evolutionary game theory explains altruism idea kin selection
Altruists discriminate individuals help favor relatives
Hamilton rule explains evolutionary rationale behind selection equation c b r cost c altruist must less benefit b recipient multiplied coefficient relatedness r The closely related two organisms causes incidences altruism increase share many alleles
This means altruistic individual ensuring alleles close relative passed survival offspring forgo option offspring number alleles passed
For example helping sibling diploid animals coefficient average individual shares alleles sibling offspring
Ensuring enough sibling offspring survive adulthood precludes necessity altruistic individual producing offspring
The coefficient values depend heavily scope playing field example choice favor includes genetic living things relatives assume discrepancy humans accounts approximately diversity playing field coefficient smaller field becomes
Similarly considered information genetic nature e g
epigenetics religion science etc
persisted time playing field becomes larger still discrepancies smaller
Computer science logic Game theory come play increasingly important role logic computer science
Several logical theories basis game semantics
In addition computer scientists used games model interactive computations
Also game theory provides theoretical basis field multi agent systems Separately game theory played role online algorithms particular k server problem past referred games moving costs request answer games
Yao principle game theoretic technique proving lower bounds computational complexity randomized algorithms especially online algorithms
The emergence internet motivated development algorithms finding equilibria games markets computational auctions peer peer systems security information markets
Algorithmic game theory within algorithmic mechanism design combine computational algorithm design analysis complex systems economic theory
Philosophy Game theory put several uses philosophy
Responding two papers W V O
Quine Lewis used game theory develop philosophical account convention
In provided first analysis common knowledge employed analyzing play coordination games
In addition first suggested one understand meaning terms signaling games
This later suggestion pursued several philosophers since Lewis
Following Lewis game theoretic account conventions Edna Ullmann Margalit Bicchieri developed theories social norms define Nash equilibria result transforming mixed motive game coordination game Game theory also challenged philosophers think terms interactive epistemology means collective common beliefs knowledge consequences knowledge social outcomes resulting interactions agents
Philosophers worked area include Bicchieri Skyrms Stalnaker In ethics notably David Gauthier Gregory Kavka Jean Hampton authors attempted pursue Thomas Hobbes project deriving morality self interest
Since games like prisoner dilemma present apparent conflict morality self interest explaining cooperation required self interest important component project
This general strategy component general social contract view political philosophy examples see Gauthier Kavka Other authors attempted use evolutionary game theory order explain emergence human attitudes morality corresponding animal behaviors
These authors look several games including prisoner dilemma stag hunt Nash bargaining game providing explanation emergence attitudes morality see e g Skyrms Sober Wilson
Retail consumer product pricing Game theory applications used heavily pricing strategies retail consumer markets particularly sale inelastic goods
With retailers constantly competing one another consumer market share become fairly common practice retailers discount certain goods intermittently hopes increasing foot traffic brick mortar locations websites visits e commerce retailers increasing sales ancillary complimentary products Black Friday popular shopping holiday US many retailers focus optimal pricing strategies capture holiday shopping market
In Black Friday scenario retailers using game theory applications typically ask dominant competitor reaction
In scenario game two players retailer consumer
The retailer focused optimal pricing strategy consumer focused best deal
In closed system often dominant strategy players alternative options
That retailers find different customer consumers shop different retailer
Given market competition today however dominant strategy retailers lies outperforming competitors
The open system assumes multiple retailers selling similar goods finite number consumers demanding goods optimal price
A blog Cornell University professor provided example strategy Amazon priced Samsung TV retail value effectively undercutting competitors
Amazon made part difference increasing price HDMI cables found consumers less price discriminatory comes sale secondary items Retail markets continue evolve strategies applications game theory comes pricing consumer goods
The key insights found simulations controlled environment real world retail experiences show applications strategies complex retailer find optimal balance pricing supplier relations brand image potential cannibalize sale profitable items
In popular culture Based book Sylvia Nasar life story game theorist mathematician John Nash turned biopic A Beautiful Mind starring Russell Crowe Nash
The military science fiction novel Starship Troopers Robert A Heinlein mentioned games theory theory games
In film name character Carl Jenkins referred military intelligence assignment assigned games theory
The film Dr Strangelove satirizes game theoretic ideas deterrence theory
For example nuclear deterrence depends threat retaliate catastrophically nuclear attack detected
A game theorist might argue threats fail credible sense lead subgame imperfect equilibria
The movie takes idea one step Russians irrevocably committing catastrophic nuclear response without making threat public

Finale summing view
Artificial intelligence modern terms generally refers computer systems mimic human cognitive functions
It encompasses independent learning problem solving
While type general artificial intelligence achieved yet contemporary artificial intelligence projects currently better understood types machine learning algorithms integrated existing data understand categorize adapt sets data without need explicit programming AI driven systems discover patterns trends discover inefficiencies predict future outcomes based historical trends ultimately enables informed decision making
As potentially beneficial many industries notably heavy industry
While application artificial intelligence heavy industry still early stages applications likely include optimization asset management operational performance well identifying efficiencies decreasing downtime
Potential benefits AI driven machines ensure easier manufacturing process along many benefits new stage advancement
Technology creates new potential task automation increasing intelligence human machine interaction
Some benefits AI include directed automation production safer operational environments reduced operating costs
Directed automation AI robots execute actions repeatedly without error design competent production models building automation solutions
They also capable eliminating human errors delivering superior levels quality assurance
production While humans must work shifts accommodate sleep mealtimes robots keep production line running continuously
Businesses expand production capabilities meet higher demands products global customers due boosted production round clock work performance
Safer operational environment More AI means fewer human laborers performing dangerous strenuous work
Logically speaking fewer humans robots performing activities associated risk number workplace accidents dramatically decrease
It also offers great opportunity exploration companies risk human life
Condensed operating costs With AI taking day day activities business considerably lower operating costs
Rather employing humans work shifts could simply invest AI
The cost incurred would maintenance machinery purchased commissioned
Environmental impacts Self driving cars potentially beneficial environment
They programmed navigate efficient route reduce idle time could result less fossil fuel consumption greenhouse gas GHG emissions
The could said heavy machinery used heavy industry
AI accurately follow sequence procedures repeatedly whereas humans prone occasional errors
Additional benefits AI AI industrial automation advanced considerably years
There evolution many new techniques innovations advances sensors increase computing capabilities
AI helps machines gather extract data identify patterns adapt new trends machine intelligence learning speech recognition
It also helps make quick data driven decisions advance process effectiveness minimize operational costs facilitate product development enable extensive scalability
Potential negatives High cost Though cost decreasing past years individual development expenditures still high basic AI
Small businesses low capital investment may difficulty generating funds necessary leverage AI
For larger companies price AI may higher depending much AI involved process
Because higher costs feasibility leveraging AI becomes challenge many companies
Nevertheless cost utilizing AI cheaper companies advent open source artificial intelligence software
Reduced employment opportunities Job opportunities grow advent AI however jobs might lost AI would replace
Any job involves repetitive tasks risk replaced
In Gartner predicted jobs would created AI also predicted jobs could lost
These figures stand true jobs within United States
AI decision making AI intelligent individuals responsible initial programming
In active shooter situation led people calling Uber escape shooting surrounding area
Instead recognizing dangerous situation algorithm Uber used saw rise demand increased prices
This type situation dangerous heavy industry one mistake cost lives cause injury
Environmental impacts Only percent electronic waste recycled despite nations enacted e waste legislation
Electronic waste expected reach million tons year
The manufacture digital devices electronics goes hand hand AI development poised damage environment
In September German car company Volkswagen witnessed international scandal
The software cars falsely activated emission controls nitrogen oxide gases NOx gases undergoing sample test
Once cars road emission controls deactivated NOx emissions increased times
NOx gases harmful cause significant health problems including respiratory problems asthma
Further studies shown additional emissions could cause premature deaths Europe result million worth lost productivity
AI trained act environmental variables might erroneous algorithms lead potentially negative effects environment
Algorithms trained biased data produce biased results
The COMPAS judicial decision support system one example biased data producing unfair outcomes
When machines develop learning decision making ability coded programmer mistakes hard trace see
As management scrutiny AI based processes essential
Effects AI manufacturing industry Landing ai startup formed Andrew Ng developed machine vision tools detect microscopic defects products resolutions well beyond human vision
The machine vision tools use machine learning algorithm tested small volumes sample images
The computer sees errors processes information learns observes In China Japan United States Republic Korea Germany together contributed percent total sales volume robots
In automotive industry sector particularly high degree automation Japan highest density industrial robots world per employees Generative design new process born artificial intelligence
Designers engineers specify design goals well material parameters manufacturing methods cost constraints generative design software
The software explores potential permutations feasible solution generates design alternatives
The software also uses machine learning test learn iteration test iterations work iterations fail
It said effectively rent computers cloud hour Artificial intelligence gradually become widely adopted modern world
AI personal assistants like Siri Alexa around military purposes since

Commonsense reasoning one branches artificial intelligence AI concerned simulating human ability make presumptions type essence ordinary situations encounter every day
These assumptions include judgments physical properties purpose intentions behavior people objects well possible outcomes actions interactions
A device exhibits commonsense reasoning capable predicting results drawing conclusions similar humans folk psychology humans innate ability reason people behavior intentions naive physics humans natural understanding physical world
Commonsense knowledge In Artificial intelligence commonsense knowledge set background information individual intended know assume ability use appropriate
It shared knowledge everybody people particular culture age group
The way obtain commonsense learning experiencing
In communication people say interlocutor expected know make presumption
Commonsense knowledge problem The commonsense knowledge problem current project sphere artificial intelligence create database contains general knowledge individuals expected represented accessible way artificial intelligence programs use natural language
Due broad scope commonsense knowledge issue considered among difficult ones AI research sphere
In order task done human mind would manage machine required appear intelligent human
Such tasks include object recognition machine translation text mining
To perform machine aware concepts individual possess commonsense knowledge recognizes
Commonsense intelligent tasks In Bar Hillel first discussed need significance practical knowledge natural language processing context machine translation
Some ambiguities resolved using simple easy acquire rules
Others require broad acknowledgement surrounding world thus require commonsense knowledge
For instance machine used translate text problems ambiguity arise could easily resolved attaining concrete true understanding context
Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous similar words
For example translating sentences The electrician working The telephone working German machine translates correctly working means laboring first one functioning properly second one
The machine seen read body texts German words laboring electrician frequently used combination found close together
The applies telephone function properly
However statistical proxy works simple cases often fails complex ones
Existing computer programs carry simple language tasks manipulating short phrases separate words attempt deeper understanding focus short term results
Computer vision Issues kind arise computer vision
For instance looking photograph bathroom items small partly seen towels body lotions recognizable due surrounding objects toilet wash basin bathtub suggest purpose room
In isolated image would difficult identify
Movies prove even difficult tasks
Some movies contain scenes moments cannot understood simply matching memorized templates images
For instance understand context movie viewer required make inferences characters intentions make presumptions depending behavior
In contemporary state art impossible build manage program perform tasks reasoning e
predicting characters actions
The done identify basic actions track characters
Robotic manipulation The need importance commonsense reasoning autonomous robots work real life uncontrolled environment evident
For instance robot programmed perform tasks waiter cocktail party sees glass picked broken waiter robot pour liquid glass instead pick another one
Such tasks seem obvious individual possess simple commonsense reasoning ensure robot avoid mistakes challenging
Successes automated commonsense reasoning Significant progress field automated commonsense reasoning made areas taxonomic reasoning actions change reasoning reasoning time
Each spheres well acknowledged theory wide range commonsense inferences
Taxonomic reasoning Taxonomy collection individuals categories relations
Taxonomies often referred semantic networks
Figure displays taxonomy categories individuals animals
Three basic relations demonstrated An individual instance category
For example individual Tweety instance category robin
One category subset another
For instance robin subset bird
Two categories disjoint
For instance robin disjoint penguin Transitivity one type inference taxonomy
Since Tweety instance robin robin subset bird follows Tweety instance bird
Inheritance another type inference
Since Tweety instance robin subset bird bird marked property canfly follows Tweety robin property canfly
When individual taxonomizes abstract categories outlining delimiting specific categories becomes problematic
Simple taxonomic structures frequently used AI programs
For instance WordNet resource including taxonomy whose elements meanings English words
Web mining systems used collect commonsense knowledge Web documents focus taxonomic relations specifically gathering taxonomic relations
Action change The theory action events change another range commonsense reasoning
There established reasoning methods domains satisfy constraints listed Events atomic meaning one event occurs time reasoner needs consider state condition world start finale specific event states still evidence going changes progress
Every single change result event Events deterministic meaning world state end event defined world state beginning specification event
There single actor events actions
The relevant state world beginning either known calculated
Temporal reasoning Temporal reasoning ability make presumptions humans knowledge times durations time intervals
For example individual knows Mozart born Hadyn died earlier use temporal reasoning knowledge deduce Mozart died younger Hadyn
The inferences involved reduce solving systems linear inequalities
To integrate kind reasoning concrete purposes natural language interpretation challenging natural language expressions context dependent interpretation
Simple tasks assigning timestamps procedures cannot done total accuracy
Qualitative reasoning Qualitative reasoning form commonsense reasoning analyzed certain success
It concerned direction change interrelated quantities
For instance price stock goes amount stocks going sold go
If ecosystem contains wolves lambs number wolves decreases death rate lambs go well
This theory firstly formulated Johan de Kleer analyzed object moving roller coaster
The theory qualitative reasoning applied many spheres physics biology engineering ecology etc
It serves basis many practical programs analogical mapping text understanding
Challenges automating commonsense reasoning As commercial systems trying make use commonsense reasoning significant
However use statistical information proxy commonsense knowledge reasoning absent
Current programs manipulate individual words attempt offer understanding
Five major obstacles interfere producing satisfactory commonsense reasoner First domains involved commonsense reasoning partly understood
Individuals far comprehensive understanding domains communication knowledge interpersonal interactions physical processes
Second situations seem easily predicted assumed could logical complexity humans commonsense knowledge cover
Some aspects similar situations studied well understood many relations unknown even principle could represented form usable computers
Third commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning
It requires coming reasonable conclusion given already known
Plausible reasoning studied many years lot theories developed include probabilistic reasoning non monotonic logic
It takes different forms include using unreliable data rules whose conclusions certain sometimes
Fourth many domains small number examples extremely frequent whereas vast number highly infrequent examples
Fifth formulating presumptions challenging discern determine level abstraction Compared humans existing computer programs perform extremely poorly modern commonsense reasoning benchmark tests Winograd Schema Challenge
The problem attaining human level competency commonsense knowledge tasks considered probably AI complete solving would require ability synthesize human level intelligence
Approaches techniques Commonsense reasoning study divided knowledge based approaches approaches based machine learning using large data corpora limited interactions two types approaches
There also crowdsourcing approaches attempting construct knowledge basis linking collective knowledge input non expert people
Knowledge based approaches separated approaches based mathematical logic
In knowledge based approaches experts analyzing characteristics inferences required reasoning specific area certain task
The knowledge based approaches consist mathematically grounded approaches informal knowledge based approaches large scale approaches
The mathematically grounded approaches purely theoretical result printed paper instead program
The work limited range domains reasoning techniques reflected
In informal knowledge based approaches theories reasoning based anecdotal data intuition results empirical behavioral psychology
Informal approaches common computer programming

An artificial brain artificial mind software hardware cognitive abilities similar animal human brain Research investigating artificial brains brain emulation plays three important roles science An ongoing attempt neuroscientists understand human brain works known cognitive neuroscience
A thought experiment philosophy artificial intelligence demonstrating possible least theory create machine capabilities human
A long term project create machines exhibiting behavior comparable animals complex central nervous system mammals particularly humans
The ultimate goal creating machine exhibiting human like behavior intelligence sometimes called strong AI An example first objective project reported Aston University Birmingham England researchers using biological cells create neurospheres small clusters neurons order develop new treatments diseases including Alzheimer motor neurone Parkinson disease
The second objective reply arguments John Searle Chinese room argument Hubert Dreyfus critique AI Roger Penrose argument The Emperor New Mind
These critics argued aspects human consciousness expertise simulated machines
One reply arguments biological processes inside brain simulated degree accuracy
This reply made early Alan Turing classic paper Computing Machinery Intelligence The third objective generally called artificial general intelligence researchers
However Ray Kurzweil prefers term strong AI
In book The Singularity Near focuses whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines approach implementing artificial brains claims grounds computer power continuing exponential growth trend could done
Henry Markram director Blue Brain project attempting brain emulation made similar claim Oxford TED conference
Approaches brain simulation Although direct human brain emulation using artificial neural networks high performance computing engine commonly discussed approach approaches
An alternative artificial brain implementation could based Holographic Neural Technology HNeT non linear phase coherence decoherence principles
The analogy made quantum processes core synaptic algorithm strong similarities quantum mechanical wave equation

In November IBM received US million grant Pentagon research creating intelligent computers
The Blue Brain project conducted assistance IBM Lausanne
The project based premise possible artificially link neurons computer placing thirty million synapses proper three dimensional position
Some proponents strong AI speculated computers connection Blue Brain Soul Catcher may exceed human intellectual capacity around likely able download human brain time around While Blue Brain able represent complex neural connections large scale project achieve link brain activity behaviors executed brain
In project Spaun Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network attempted model multiple parts human brain large scale representations neural connections generate complex behaviors addition mapping Spaun design recreates elements human brain anatomy
The model consisting approximately million neurons includes features visual motor cortices GABAergic dopaminergic connections ventral tegmental area VTA substantia nigra others
The design allows several functions response eight tasks using visual inputs typed handwritten characters outputs carried mechanical arm
Spaun functions include copying drawing recognizing images counting There good reasons believe regardless implementation strategy predictions realising artificial brains near future optimistic
In particular brains including human brain cognition currently well understood scale computation required unknown
Another near term limitation current approaches brain simulation require orders magnitude larger power consumption compared human brain
The human brain consumes W power whereas current supercomputers may use much MW e order
Artificial brain thought experiment Some critics brain simulation believe simpler create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature
Some commentators used analogy early attempts construct flying machines modeled birds modern aircraft look like birds

Computer Arimaa refers playing board game Arimaa computer programs
In Indian American computer engineer Omar Syed published rules Arimaa announced prize available annually first computer program running standard shelf hardware able defeat three top ranked human players three game series
The prize claimed computer program played three human players
The game subject several research papers
State space Arimaa Opening The number different ways player set pieces beginning game displaystyle dbinom cdot dbinom cdot dbinom cdot dbinom cdot dbinom cdot dbinom The player put rabbits possible squares followed cats remaining squares dogs remaining squares horses four remaining squares one camel one two remaining squares elephant final unused square
Because player start game one opening setups total state space opening displaystyle approx cdot As Christ Jan Cox said Master thesis number possible initial states large follows difficult develop complete databases opening moves
Artificial intelligence techniques Material evaluation It important computer able evaluate value pieces board assess whether capture exchange would desirable
Assessing relative value pieces area ongoing Arimaa research
Some currently used systems DAPE FAME
Techniques used Arimaa bots The following techniques used artificial intelligence programs play Arimaa Bitboards Transposition tables Zobrist hashing Minimax Alpha beta pruning Killer moves refutation tables Static evaluation function Quiescence search Monte Carlo Tree Search UCT Techniques rarely used In Arimaa bots Opening book Endgame tablebase Computer performance Several aspects Arimaa make difficult computer programs beat good human players
Because much effort gone development strong chess playing software particularly relevant understand techniques applicable chess less effective Arimaa
Brute force searching Traditional chess programs use brute force searching coupled static position evaluation dominated material considerations
They examine many many possible moves good compared humans determining winning end series moves unless one side pieces
The true Arimaa programs results good practice
When brute force searching applied Arimaa depth search limited huge number options player turn
Computationally number options player available governs number different paths play go
This known branching factor
The average branching factor game Chess whereas Arimaa These differing branching factors imply computer search depth eight turns player chess search three turns deep player Arimaa displaystyle approxeq Alpha beta pruning Brute force search depth chess software nearly doubled alpha beta pruning allows software conclude one move better another without examining every possible continuation weaker move
If opponent crush certain move one reply necessary examine replies dramatically increases search speed
In Arimaa however side move switches every four steps reduces number available cutoffs step based search
Furthermore usefulness alpha beta pruning heavily dependent order moves considered
Good moves must considered bad ones order bad ones neglected
In particular checking capturing moves key pruning often much better moves
In Arimaa software speedup provided alpha beta pruning less captures rarer
In rated games played arimaa com steps result capture compared chess moves result capture
In Arimaa positions particularly toward beginning game board still crowded competent player avoid losing pieces within next two turns
Compared chess Arimaa allows either player delay captures longer
Indeed median move number first capture chess turn whereas Arimaa turn
The struggle initially positional Arimaa revolves around making captures unavoidable point future
This magnifies importance correctly judging gaining ground non material ways
Thus strength computer programs examining millions positions significant weakness judging position apart pieces
The weakness Arimaa programs opening phases magnified setup phase
In chess every game starts position
By compiling game list stock replies standard opening moves chess programs may often make dozen excellent moves starting think
Humans smaller less reliable memory openings puts humans relative disadvantage chess
Arimaa contrast millions possible ways set pieces even first piece moves
This prevents programs meaningful opening book
As game progresses exchanges advancement rabbits tend make position open tactical
Arimaa programs typically play better sort position see tactical shots humans overlook
However usually possible humans avoid wide open positions conservative play angle strategic positions computers fare worse
Against conservative opponent almost impossible bust open position Arimaa whereas chess merely difficult
One must beat defensive play accumulation small long term advantages programs well
One additional technique computer chess apply Arimaa endgame tablebases
Master level chess games sometimes trade unclear endgames pieces example king knight vs king rook
It possible build retrograde analysis exhaustive table correct move positions
Programs consult pre generated table positions rather thinking afresh gives relative advantage humans
Arimaa contrast seldom comes endgame
Equal exchanges pieces less common chess rare game Arimaa trade still unclear
An average game Arimaa eight captures compared seventeen chess top humans often defeat top programs Arimaa without losing single piece example second game Challenge match
Another example low capture density semifinal game World Championship featuring single capture goal forcing elephant sacrifice
Omar Syed hopes traditional artificial intelligence techniques moderately effective Arimaa programmers forced use new artificial intelligence techniques create strong Arimaa playing program
The successful quest build world championship caliber chess program produced many techniques successfully play games contributed essentially nothing general reasoning fact techniques chess playing programs excluded definitions artificial intelligence goal Arimaa techniques involved playing help larger goals artificial intelligence
The structure Syed man machine challenge focused rewarding advances AI software advances hardware
In annual challenge programs run machines chosen provided Syed criterion typical inexpensive shelf home computer
The challenge would open anyone requiring expensive multi processor machines used challenge top level chess players much less something like custom built supercomputer Deep Blue even though success hardware intensive approach inspired Arimaa invention
Syed believes even computer used challenge match Pentium GHz system MB RAM sufficient hardware win challenge prize running proper software
Supercomputers might already power conquer Arimaa brute force using conventional AI software eventually personal computers hardware continues advance current rate
This Arimaa challenge prize offered year
Comparing Arimaa Challenge chess challenges It argued computer beaten world chess champion beaten human Arimaa Challenge six reasons Arimaa new game
Therefore number programmers amount time devoted computer Arimaa much less computer chess
Computer chess thousands programmers years computer Arimaa

Despite power deep learning methods still lack much functionality needed realizing goal entirely
Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted Realistically deep learning part larger challenge building intelligent machines
Such techniques lack ways representing causal relationships obvious ways performing logical inferences also still long way integrating abstract knowledge information objects typically used
The powerful A I
systems like Watson use techniques like deep learning one element complicated ensemble techniques ranging statistical technique Bayesian inference deductive reasoning
As alternative emphasis limits deep learning one author speculated might possible train machine vision stack perform sophisticated task discriminating old master amateur figure drawings hypothesized sensitivity might represent rudiments non trivial machine empathy
This author proposed would line anthropology identifies concern aesthetics key element behavioral modernity In reference idea artistic sensitivity might inhere within relatively low levels cognitive hierarchy published series graphic representations internal states deep layers neural networks attempting discern within essentially random data images trained demonstrate visual appeal original research notice received well comments subject time frequently accessed article The Guardian website
Errors Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors confidently classifying unrecognizable images belonging familiar category ordinary images misclassifying minuscule perturbations correctly classified images
Goertzel hypothesized behaviors due limitations internal representations limitations would inhibit integration heterogeneous multi component artificial general intelligence AGI architectures
These issues may possibly addressed deep learning architectures internally form states homologous image grammar decompositions observed entities events
Learning grammar visual linguistic training data would equivalent restricting system commonsense reasoning operates concepts terms grammatical production rules basic goal human language acquisition artificial intelligence AI
Cyber threat As deep learning moves lab world research experience shows artificial neural networks vulnerable hacks deception
By identifying patterns systems use function attackers modify inputs ANNs way ANN finds match human observers would recognize
For example attacker make subtle changes image ANN finds match even though image looks human nothing like search target
Such manipulation termed adversarial attack In researchers used one ANN doctor images trial error fashion identify another focal points thereby generate images deceived
The modified images looked different human eyes
Another group showed printouts doctored images photographed successfully tricked image classification system
One defense reverse image search possible fake image submitted site TinEye find instances
A refinement search using parts image identify images piece may taken Another group showed certain psychedelic spectacles could fool facial recognition system thinking ordinary people celebrities potentially allowing one person impersonate another
In researchers added stickers stop signs caused ANN misclassify ANNs however trained detect attempts deception potentially leading attackers defenders arms race similar kind already defines malware defense industry
ANNs trained defeat ANN based anti malware software repeatedly attacking defense malware continually altered genetic algorithm tricked anti malware retaining ability damage target Another group demonstrated certain sounds could make Google Now voice command system open particular web address would download malware In data poisoning false data continually smuggled machine learning system training set prevent achieving mastery
Reliance human microwork Most Deep Learning systems rely training verification data generated annotated humans
It argued media philosophy low payed clickwork e g
Amazon Mechanical Turk regularly deployed purpose also implicit forms human microwork often recognized
The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types machinic capture human microwork generate training data gamification embedding annotation computation tasks flow game trapping tracking e g
CAPTCHAs image recognition click tracking Google search results pages exploitation social motivations e g

Mühlhoff argues commercial end user applications Deep Learning Facebook face recognition system need training data stop ANN trained
Rather continued demand human generated verification data constantly calibrate update ANN
For purpose Facebook introduced feature user automatically recognized image receive notification
They choose whether like publicly labeled image tell Facebook picture
This user interface mechanism generate constant stream verification data train network real time
As Mühlhoff argues involvement human users generate training verification data typical commercial end user applications Deep Learning systems may referred human aided artificial intelligence

In automated journalism also known algorithmic journalism robot journalism news articles generated computer programs
Through artificial intelligence AI software stories produced automatically computers rather human reporters
These programs interpret organize present data human readable ways
Typically process involves algorithm scans large amounts provided data selects assortment pre programmed article structures orders key points inserts details names places amounts rankings statistics figures
The output also customized fit certain voice tone style Data science AI companies Automated Insights Narrative Science United Robots Yseop develop provide algorithms news outlets
As media organizations used automated journalism
Early adopters include news providers Associated Press Forbes ProPublica Los Angeles Times Due formulaic nature automation mainly used stories based statistics numerical figures
Common topics include sports recaps weather financial reports real estate analysis earnings reviews
StatSheet online platform covering college basketball runs entirely automated program
The Associated Press began using automation cover minor baseball leagues games annually using program Automated Insights statistics MLB Advanced Media
Outside sports Associated Press also uses automation produce stories corporate earnings
In Thomson Reuters announced switch automation generate financial news stories online news platform
More famously algorithm called Quakebot published story California earthquake The Los Angeles Times website within three minutes shaking stopped Automated journalism sometimes seen opportunity free journalists routine reporting providing time complex tasks
It also allows efficiency cost cutting alleviating financial burden many news organizations face
However automated journalism also perceived threat authorship quality news precarity employment within industry
Benefits Speed Robot reporters built produce large quantities information quicker speeds
The Associated Press announced use automation increased volume earnings reports customers ten times
With software Automated Insights data companies produce word articles time takes journalists crunch numbers prepare information
By automating routine stories tasks journalists promised time complex jobs investigative reporting depth analysis events Francesco Marconi Associated Press stated automation news agency freed percent reporters time focus higher impact projects
Cost Automated journalism cheaper content produced within less time
It also lowers labour costs news organizations
Reduced human input means less expenses wages salaries paid leaves vacations employment insurance
Automation serves cost cutting tool news outlets struggling tight budgets still wish maintain scope quality coverage
Criticisms Authorship In automated story often confusion credited author
Several participants study algorithmic authorship attributed credit programmer others perceived news organization author emphasizing collaborative nature work
There also way reader verify whether article written robot human raises issues transparency although issues also arise respect authorship attribution human authors
Credibility quality Concerns perceived credibility automated news different concerns perceived credibility news general
Critics doubt algorithms fair accurate free subjectivity error attempted influence
Again issues fairness accuracy subjectivity error attempts influence propaganda also present articles written humans thousands years
It also remarked sources want name
machines replace human capabilities creativity humour critical thinking
Substantial research automated authoring pursued success mimicking human humor thinking abilities although lot improvement still needs done existing techniques
At point computers alone lack ability write stories perspective emotion thorough analysis surprising observations
Beyond human evaluation numerous algorithmic methods identify machine written articles
Although articles may still contain errors obvious human identify times score better automatic identifiers human written articles
Employment Among concerns automation loss employment journalists dissimilar loss jobs hand scribes invention printing press telephone operators connected trunks enable long distance calling
In interest saving costs mentioned previously news organizations inclined cut staff switching cheaper faster machines
In annual census The American Society News Editors announced newspaper industry lost full time professional editors
Falling within year biggest drop since industry cut jobs
Benefits Issues The future automated journalism seen beneficial however others would argue could detrimental industry removes sense objectivity
However argument ludicrous journalists human beings subjective
For example media regularly spreads news government wants spread e g respect WMDs Iraq War
As stated benefits section costs efficiency robot journalism present proven however people opined utilizing system automation may separate audience article
There exists evidence claims however
This happen human journalist writing world issues may personal writing style attached story whereas article written using automation would result story bland personality although people made comments failed provide evidence claims largely lacked understanding inner workings algorithmic processes
They said without giving evidence automated articles written within firm would style similar sense journalist would lost process
In reality easy make algorithm variations style
Largely algorithms mimic styles existing writers genres models differences different authors
Just algorithm paint style Van Gogh early Chinese style generate different articles using different styles
For example article legislative news made cut dry matter fact whereas article fashion show infused colorful descriptions comments
The question regarding issue problems claimed exist current technologies without providing evidence
In industry may change new technological advancements may made implement fix issues currently associated thought using robot journalism
However need lot education area get point human beings make random claims automated journalism without understanding really without evidence usual scientific endeavors
A Nieman Reports article identifies whether machines replace journalists addresses many concerns around concept automated journalism practices
They discuss benefits surrounding concepts automated journalism beneficial industry however ultimately support idea human journalists stay around matter much technology changes
Their rationale supported thought benefits automation never outweigh perks skilled journalist date current technological advancements
Human attempts foreseeing future foretelling fraught spectacular failures
It interesting see prediction ages near future
Nevertheless due journalism industry reliance technology industry must stay dynamic shift current trends
The professionals work within field must field competitive saturated due internet
As internet caused many shifts way industry operates also opened avenue citizen journalist participate media much frequently
Due many people owning smartphones access online databases media sites many people taken roles amateur journalists
Overall benefited industry efficiency perspective however seen hurting professionals work journalism field want see especially carefully study real effects go perceptions opinions
It hope instead conjectures wild guesses research field carefully examine issues make measured accurate claims

A superintelligence may may created intelligence explosion associated technological singularity
University Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence intellect greatly exceeds cognitive performance humans virtually domains interest
The program Fritz falls short superintelligence even though much better humans chess Fritz cannot outperform humans tasks
Following Hutter Legg Bostrom treats superintelligence general dominance goal oriented behavior leaving open whether artificial human superintelligence would possess capacities intentionality cf
Chinese room argument first person consciousness cf
hard problem consciousness
Technological researchers disagree likely present day human intelligence surpassed
Some argue advances artificial intelligence AI probably result general reasoning systems lack human cognitive limitations
Others believe humans evolve directly modify biology achieve radically greater intelligence
A number futures studies scenarios combine elements possibilities suggesting humans likely interface computers upload minds computers way enables substantial intelligence amplification
Some researchers believe superintelligence likely follow shortly development artificial general intelligence
The first generally intelligent machines likely immediately hold enormous advantage least forms mental capability including capacity perfect recall vastly superior knowledge base ability multitask ways possible biological entities
This may give opportunity either single new species become much powerful humans displace A number scientists forecasters argue prioritizing early research possible benefits risks human machine cognitive enhancement potential social impact technologies
Feasibility artificial superintelligence Philosopher David Chalmers argues artificial general intelligence likely path superhuman intelligence
Chalmers breaks claim argument AI achieve equivalence human intelligence extended surpass human intelligence amplified completely dominate humans across arbitrary tasks Concerning human level equivalence Chalmers argues human brain mechanical system therefore ought emulatable synthetic materials
He also notes human intelligence able biologically evolve making likely human engineers able recapitulate invention
Evolutionary algorithms particular able produce human level AI
Concerning intelligence extension amplification Chalmers argues new AI technologies generally improved particularly likely invention assist designing new technologies If research strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software would able reprogram improve feature called recursive self improvement
It would even better improving could continue rapidly increasing cycle leading superintelligence
This scenario known intelligence explosion
Such intelligence would limitations human intellect may able invent discover almost anything
Computer components already greatly surpass human performance speed
Bostrom writes Biological neurons operate peak speed Hz full seven orders magnitude slower modern microprocessor GHz
Moreover neurons transmit spike signals across axons greater whereas existing electronic processing cores communicate optically speed light
Thus simplest example superintelligence may emulated human mind run much faster hardware brain
A human like reasoner could think millions times faster current humans would dominant advantage reasoning tasks particularly ones require haste long strings actions
Another advantage computers modularity size computational capacity increased
A non human modified human brain could become much larger present day human brain like many supercomputers
Bostrom also raises possibility collective superintelligence large enough number separate reasoning systems communicated coordinated well enough could act aggregate far greater capabilities sub agent
There may also ways qualitatively improve human reasoning decision making
Humans appear differ chimpanzees ways think differ brain size speed
Humans outperform non human animals large part new enhanced reasoning capacities long term planning language use
See evolution human intelligence primate cognition
If possible improvements reasoning would similarly large impact makes likelier agent built outperforms humans fashion humans outperform chimpanzees All advantages hold artificial superintelligence clear many hold biological superintelligence
Physiological constraints limit speed size biological brains many ways inapplicable machine intelligence
As writers superintelligence devoted much attention superintelligent AI scenarios
Feasibility biological superintelligence Carl Sagan suggested advent Caesarean sections vitro fertilization may permit humans evolve larger heads resulting improvements via natural selection heritable component human intelligence
By contrast Gerald Crabtree argued decreased selection pressure resulting slow centuries long reduction human intelligence process instead likely continue future
There scientific consensus concerning either possibility cases biological change would slow especially relative rates cultural change
Selective breeding nootropics NSI MAO I epigenetic modulation genetic engineering could improve human intelligence rapidly
Bostrom writes come understand genetic component intelligence pre implantation genetic diagnosis could used select embryos much points IQ gain one embryo selected two larger gains e g IQ points gained one embryo selected
If process iterated many generations gains could order magnitude greater
Bostrom suggests deriving new gametes embryonic stem cells could used iterate selection process rapidly
A well organized society high intelligence humans sort could potentially achieve collective superintelligence Alternatively collective intelligence might constructible better organizing humans present levels individual intelligence
A number writers suggested human civilization aspect e g Internet economy coming function like global brain capacities far exceeding component agents
If systems based superintelligence relies heavily artificial components however may qualify AI rather biology based superorganism A final method intelligence amplification would directly enhance individual humans opposed enhancing social reproductive dynamics
This could achieved using nootropics somatic gene therapy brain computer interfaces
However Bostrom expresses skepticism scalability first two approaches argues designing superintelligent cyborg interface AI complete problem
Forecasts Most surveyed AI researchers expect machines eventually able rival humans intelligence though little consensus likely happen
At AI conference attendees reported expecting machines able simulate learning every aspect human intelligence attendees expected happen sometime expected machines never reach milestone In survey cited authors AI May according Microsoft academic search median year respondents expected machines carry human professions least well typical human assuming global catastrophe occurs confidence mean st dev
years confidence mean st dev
years confidence mean st dev
years
These estimates exclude respondents said year would ever reach confidence said never confidence said never confidence
Respondents assigned median probability possibility machine superintelligence invented within years invention approximately human level machine intelligence
Design considerations Bostrom expressed concern values superintelligence designed
He compared several proposals The coherent extrapolated volition CEV proposal values upon humans would converge
The moral rightness MR proposal value moral rightness
The moral permissibility MP proposal value staying within bounds moral permissibility otherwise CEV values Bostrom clarifies terms instead implementing humanity coherent extrapolated volition one could try build AI goal morally right relying AI superior cognitive capacities figure actions fit description
We call proposal moral rightness MR MR would also appear disadvantages
It relies notion morally right notoriously difficult concept one philosophers grappled since antiquity without yet attaining consensus analysis
Picking erroneous explication moral rightness could result outcomes would morally wrong
The path endowing AI moral concepts might involve giving general linguistic ability comparable least normal human adult
Such general ability understand natural language could used understand meant morally right If AI could grasp meaning could search actions fit One might try preserve basic idea MR model reducing demandingness focusing moral permissibility idea could let AI pursue humanity CEV long act ways morally impermissible
Responding Bostrom Santos Lang raised concern developers may attempt start single kind superintelligence
Potential threat humanity It suggested AI systems rapidly become superintelligent may take unforeseen actions compete humanity
Researchers argued way intelligence explosion self improving AI could become powerful unstoppable humans Concerning human extinction scenarios Bostrom identifies superintelligence possible cause When create first superintelligent entity might make mistake give goals lead annihilate humankind assuming enormous intellectual advantage gives power
For example could mistakenly elevate subgoal status supergoal
We tell solve mathematical problem complies turning matter solar system giant calculating device process killing person asked question
In theory since superintelligent AI would able bring almost possible outcome thwart attempt prevent implementation goals many uncontrolled unintended consequences could arise
It could kill agents persuade change behavior block attempts interference
Eliezer Yudkowsky illustrates instrumental convergence follows The AI hate love made atoms use something else
This presents AI control problem build intelligent agent aid creators avoiding inadvertently building superintelligence harm creators
The danger designing control right first time superintelligence may able seize power environment prevent humans shutting
Potential AI control strategies include capability control limiting AI ability influence world motivational control building AI whose goals aligned human values

Neural machine translation NMT approach machine translation uses artificial neural network predict likelihood sequence words typically modeling entire sentences single integrated model
Properties They require fraction memory needed traditional statistical machine translation SMT models
Furthermore unlike conventional translation systems parts neural translation model trained jointly end end maximize translation performance
History Deep learning applications appeared first speech recognition
The first scientific paper using neural networks machine translation appeared followed lot advances following years
Large vocabulary NMT application Image captioning Subword NMT Multilingual NMT Multi Source NMT Character dec NMT Zero Resource NMT Google Fully Character NMT Zero Shot NMT In first appearance NMT system public machine translation competition OpenMT
WMT also first time NMT contender following year already NMT systems among winners
Workings NMT departs phrase based statistical approaches use separately engineered subcomponents
Neural machine translation NMT drastic step beyond traditionally done statistical machine translation SMT
Its main departure use vector representations embeddings continuous space representations words internal states
The structure models simpler phrase based models
There separate language model translation model reordering model single sequence model predicts one word time
However sequence prediction conditioned entire source sentence entire already produced target sequence
NMT models use deep learning representation learning
The word sequence modeling first typically done using recurrent neural network RNN
A bidirectional recurrent neural network known encoder used neural network encode source sentence second RNN known decoder used predict words target language Convolutional Neural Networks Convnets principle somewhat better long continuous sequences initially used due several weaknesses successfully compensated using called attention based approaches
There Coverage Models addressing issues traditional attention mechanism ignoring past alignment information leading translation translation
Usages By best MT systems using neural networks Google Microsoft IBM Yandex PROMT translation services use NMT
Google uses Google Neural Machine Translation GNMT preference previous statistical methods
Microsoft uses similar technology speech translations including Microsoft Translator live Skype Translator
An open source neural machine translation system OpenNMT released Harvard NLP group The NMT technology used outside scope natural language
For instance shown NMT also work source code computer programs
With careful encoding source code SequenceR automatic bug fixing system trained past commits mined Git repositories able generate correct one line patches

In artificial intelligence AI anticipation occurs agent makes decisions based explicit beliefs future
More broadly anticipation also refer ability act appropriate ways take future events account without necessarily explicitly possessing model future events
In AI An agent employing anticipation would try predict future state environment weather case make use predictions decision making
For example If sky cloudy air pressure low probably rain soon take umbrella
Otherwise leave umbrella home
These rules explicitly take account possible future events
In Robert Rosen defined anticipatory system follows A system containing predictive model environment allows change state instant accord model predictions pertaining later instant To extent Rosen definition anticipation applies system incorporating machine learning

In artificial intelligence intelligent agent IA refers autonomous entity acts directing activity towards achieving goals e
agent upon environment using observation sensors consequent actuators e
intelligent
Intelligent agents may also learn use knowledge achieve goals
They may simple complex
A reflex machine thermostat considered example intelligent agent
Intelligent agents often described schematically abstract functional system similar computer program
For reason intelligent agents sometimes called abstract intelligent agents AIA distinguish real world implementations computer systems biological systems organizations
Some definitions intelligent agents emphasize autonomy prefer term autonomous intelligent agents
Still others notably Russell Norvig considered goal directed behavior essence intelligence prefer term borrowed economics rational agent
Intelligent agents artificial intelligence closely related agents economics versions intelligent agent paradigm studied cognitive science ethics philosophy practical reason well many interdisciplinary socio cognitive modeling computer social simulations
Intelligent agents also closely related software agents autonomous computer program carries tasks behalf users
In computer science term intelligent agent may used refer software agent intelligence regardless rational agent Russell Norvig definition
For example autonomous programs used operator assistance data mining sometimes referred bots also called intelligent agents
A variety definitions Intelligent agents defined many different ways
According Nikola Kasabov IA systems exhibit following characteristics Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally Adapt online real time Are able analyze terms behavior error success
Learn improve interaction environment embodiment Learn quickly large amounts data Have memory based exemplar storage retrieval capacities Have parameters represent short long term memory age forgetting etc
Structure agents A simple agent program defined mathematically function f called agent function maps every possible percepts sequence possible action agent perform coefficient feedback element function constant affects eventual actions f P A displaystyle f P ast rightarrow A Agent function abstract concept could incorporate various principles decision making like calculation utility individual options deduction logic rules fuzzy logic etc The program agent instead maps every possible percept action
We use term percept refer agent perceptional inputs given instant
In following figures agent anything viewed perceiving environment sensors acting upon environment actuators
Architectures Weiss defines four classes agents Logic based agents decision action perform made via logical deduction Reactive agents decision making implemented form direct mapping situation action Belief desire intention agents decision making depends upon manipulation data structures representing beliefs desires intentions agent finally Layered architectures decision making realized via various software layers less explicitly reasoning environment different levels abstraction Generally agent constructed separating body sensors actuators operates complex perception system takes description world input controller outputs commands actuator
However hierarchy controller layers often necessary balance immediate reaction desired low level tasks slow reasoning complex high level goals
Classes Russell Norvig group agents five classes based degree perceived intelligence capability simple reflex agents model based reflex agents goal based agents utility based agents learning agents Simple reflex agents Simple reflex agents act basis current percept ignoring rest percept history
The agent function based condition action rule condition action
This agent function succeeds environment fully observable
Some reflex agents also contain information current state allows disregard conditions whose actuators already triggered
Infinite loops often unavoidable simple reflex agents operating partially observable environments
Note If agent randomize actions may possible escape infinite loops
Model based reflex agents A model based agent handle partially observable environments
Its current state stored inside agent maintaining kind structure describes part world cannot seen
This knowledge world works called model world hence name model based agent
A model based reflex agent maintain sort internal model depends percept history thereby reflects least unobserved aspects current state
Percept history impact action environment determined using internal model
It chooses action way reflex agent
An agent may also use models describe predict behaviors agents environment
Goal based agents Goal based agents expand capabilities model based agents using goal information
Goal information describes situations desirable
This allows agent way choose among multiple possibilities selecting one reaches goal state
Search planning subfields artificial intelligence devoted finding action sequences achieve agent goals
Utility based agents Goal based agents distinguish goal states non goal states
It possible define measure desirable particular state
This measure obtained use utility function maps state measure utility state
A general performance measure allow comparison different world states according exactly happy would make agent
The term utility used describe happy agent
A rational utility based agent chooses action maximizes expected utility action outcomes agent expects derive average given probabilities utilities outcome
A utility based agent model keep track environment tasks involved great deal research perception representation reasoning learning
Learning agents Learning advantage allows agents initially operate unknown environments become competent initial knowledge alone might allow
The important distinction learning element responsible making improvements performance element responsible selecting external actions
The learning element uses feedback critic agent determines performance element modified better future
The performance element previously considered entire agent takes percepts decides actions
The last component learning agent problem generator
It responsible suggesting actions lead new informative experiences
Hierarchies agents To actively perform functions Intelligent Agents today normally gathered hierarchical structure containing many sub agents
Intelligent sub agents process perform lower level functions
Taken together intelligent agent sub agents create complete system accomplish difficult tasks goals behaviors responses display form intelligence
Applications Intelligent agents applied automated online assistants function perceive needs customers order perform individualized customer service
Such agent may basically consist dialog system avatar well expert system provide specific expertise user
They also used optimize coordination human groups online

Manifold alignment class machine learning algorithms produce projections sets data given original data sets lie common manifold
The concept first introduced Ham Lee Saul adding manifold constraint general problem correlating sets high dimensional vectors
Overview Manifold alignment assumes disparate data sets produced similar generating processes share similar underlying manifold representation
By learning projections original space shared manifold correspondences recovered knowledge one domain transferred another
Most manifold alignment techniques consider two data sets concept extends arbitrarily many initial data sets
Consider case aligning two data sets X displaystyle X Y displaystyle Y X R displaystyle X_ mathbb R Y R n displaystyle Y_ mathbb R n
Manifold alignment algorithms attempt project X displaystyle X Y displaystyle Y new dimensional space projections minimize distance corresponding points preserve local manifold structure original data
The projection functions denoted ϕ X R R displaystyle phi _ X mathbb R rightarrow mathbb R ϕ Y R n R displaystyle phi _ Y mathbb R n rightarrow mathbb R Let W displaystyle W represent binary correspondence matrix points X displaystyle X Y displaystyle Y W j f X Y j h e r w e displaystyle W_ j begin cases X_ leftrightarrow Y_ j otherwise end cases Let S X displaystyle S_ X S Y displaystyle S_ Y represent pointwise similarities within data sets
This usually encoded heat kernel adjacency matrix k nearest neighbor graph
Finally introduce coefficient μ displaystyle leq mu leq tuned adjust weight preserve manifold structure goal versus minimize corresponding point distances goal
With definitions place loss function manifold alignment written arg min ϕ X ϕ Y μ j ϕ X X ϕ X X j S X j μ j ϕ Y Y ϕ Y Y j S Y j μ j ϕ X X ϕ Y Y j W j displaystyle arg min _ phi _ X phi _ Y mu sum _ j left Vert phi _ X left X_ right phi _ X left X_ j right right Vert S_ X j mu sum _ j left Vert phi _ Y left Y_ right phi _ Y left Y_ j right right Vert S_ Y j left mu right sum _ j Vert phi _ X left X_ right phi _ Y left Y_ j right Vert W_ j Solving optimization problem equivalent solving generalized eigenvalue problem using graph laplacian joint matrix G G μ S X μ W μ W T μ S Y displaystyle G left begin array cc mu S_ X left mu right W left mu right W T mu S_ Y end array right Inter data correspondences The algorithm described requires full pairwise correspondence information input data sets supervised learning paradigm
However information usually difficult impossible obtain real world applications
Recent work extended core manifold alignment algorithm semi supervised unsupervised multiple instance settings
One step vs two step alignment The algorithm described performs one step alignment finding embeddings data sets time
A similar effect also achieved two step alignments following slightly modified procedure Project input data set lower dimensional space independently using variety dimension reduction algorithms
Perform linear manifold alignment embedded data holding first data set fixed mapping additional data set onto first manifold
This approach benefit decomposing required computation lowers memory overhead allows parallel implementations
Instance level vs feature level projections Manifold alignment used find linear feature level projections nonlinear instance level embeddings
While instance level version generally produces accurate alignments sacrifices great degree flexibility learned embedding often difficult parameterize
Feature level projections allow new instances easily embedded manifold space projections may combined form direct mappings original data representations
These properties especially important knowledge transfer applications
Applications Manifold alignment suited problems several corpora lie shared manifold even corpus different dimensionality
Many real world problems fit description traditional techniques able take advantage corpora time
Manifold alignment also facilitates transfer learning knowledge one domain used jump start learning correlated domains
Applications manifold alignment include Cross language information retrieval automatic translationBy representing documents vector word counts manifold alignment recover mapping documents different languages
Cross language document correspondence relatively easy obtain especially multi lingual organizations like European Union
Transfer learning policy state representations reinforcement learning Alignment protein NMR structures Accelerating model learning robotics sharing data generated robots References Further reading Xiong L F Wang C Zhang

Document mosaicing process stitches multiple overlapping snapshot images document together produce one large high resolution composite
The document slid stationary desk camera hand parts document snapshotted camera field view
As document slid camera motion document coarsely tracked vision system
The document periodically snapshotted successive snapshots overlap
The system finds overlapped pairs stitches together repeatedly pairs stitched together one piece document The document mosaicing divided four main processes
Tracking Feature detecting Correspondences establishing Images mosaicing
Tracking simple correlation process In process motion document slid camera coarsely tracked system
Tracking performed process called simple correlation process
In first frame snapshots small patch extracted center image correlation template shown Figure
The correlation process performed four times size patch area next frame
The motion paper indicated peak correlation function
The peak correlation function indicates motion paper
The template resampled frame tracking continues template reaches edge document
After template reaches edge document another snapshot taken tracking process performs repeatedly whole document imaged
The snapshots stored ordered list facilitate pairing overlapped images later processes
Feature detecting efficient matching Feature detection process finding transformation aligns one image another
There two main approaches feature detection
Feature based approach Motion parameters estimated point correspondences
This approach suitable case plenty supply stable detectable features
Featureless approach When motion two images small motion parameters estimated using optical flow
On hand motion two images large motion parameters estimated using generalised cross correlation
However approach requires computationally expensive resources Each image segmented hierarchy columns lines words match organised sets features across images
Skew angle estimation columns lines words finding examples feature detection operations
Skew angle estimation Firstly angle rows text make image raster lines skew angle estimated
It assumed lie range
A small patch text image selected randomly rotated range variance pixel intensities patch summed along raster lines maximised
See Figure
To ensure found skew angle accurate document mosaic system performs calculation many image patches derive final estimation finding average individual angles weighted variance pixel intensities patch
Columns lines words finding In operation de skewed document intuitively segmented hierarchy columns lines words

Columns easily segmented binary gradient de skewed images summing pixels vertically shown Figure
Baselines row segmented way column segmentation process horizontally
Finally individual words segmented applying vertical process segmented row These segmentations important document mosaic created matching lower right corners words overlapping images pair
Moreover segmentation operation organize list images context hierarchy rows column reliably
The segmentation operation involves considerable amount summing binary gradient de skewed images done construct matrix partial sums whose elements given p u v j b u v displaystyle p_ iy sum _ u sum _ v j b_ uv The matrix partial sums calculated one pass binary gradient de skewed image

Seed match finding A seed match finding done comparing row image row image
The two rows compared every word
If length pixel two words one image one image immediate neighbours agree within predefined tolerance threshold pixels example assumed match
The row image assumed match three word matches two rows
The seed match finding operation terminated two pairs consecutive row match found
Match list building After finishing seed match finding operation next process build match list generate correspondences points two images
The process done searching matching pairs rows away seed row
Images mosaicing Given list corresponding points two images finding transformation overlapping portion images next process
Assuming pinhole camera model transformation pixels u v image pixels u v image demonstrated plane plane projectivity

RANSAC regression technique used reject outlying matches estimate projectivity remaining good matches
The projectivity fine tuned using correlation corners overlapping portion obtain four correspondences sub pixel accuracy
Therefore image transformed image coordinate system using Eq
The typical result process shown Figure
Many images coping Finally whole page composition built mapping images coordinate system anchor image normally one nearest page center
The transformations anchor frame calculated concatenating pair wise transformations found earlier

Computational Heuristic Intelligence CHI refers specialized programming techniques computational intelligence also called artificial intelligence AI
These techniques express goal avoiding complexity issues also called NP hard problems using human like techniques
They best summarized use exemplar based methods heuristics rather rule based methods algorithms
Hence term distinct conventional computational algorithmic intelligence GOFAI
An example CHI technique encoding specificity principle Tulving Thompson
In general CHI principles problem solving techniques used people rather programmed machines
It drawing attention key distinction use term justified field already replete confusing neologisms
Note legal systems modern human societies employ heuristics generalisations cases individual trial records well legislated statutes rules regulatory guides
Another recent approach avoidance complexity issues employ feedback control rather feedforward modeling problem solving paradigm
This approach called computational cybernetics term computational associated conventional computer programming techniques represent strategic compiled feedforward model problem b term cybernetic associated conventional system operation techniques represent tactical interpreted feedback model problem
Of course real programs real problems contain feedforward feedback components
A real example illustrates point human cognition clearly involves perceptual bottom feedback sensor oriented conceptual top feedforward motor oriented information flows hierarchies
The AI engineer must choose mathematical cybernetic problem solution machine design paradigms
This coding program language issue relates understanding relationship declarative procedural programming paradigms
The vast majority STEM professionals never get opportunity design implement pure cybernetic solutions
When pushed responders dismiss importance difference saying code reduced mathematical model anyway
Unfortunately belief false fails spectacularly many AI scenarios
Mathematical models time agnostic nature pre computed ie feedforward
Dyer Feldman independently investigated simplest somatic governance paradigms namely control simple jointed limb single flexor muscle
They found impossible determine forces limb positions therefore problem cannot pre computed feedforward mathematical solution
Instead top command bias signal changes threshold feedback level sensorimotor loop eg loop formed afferent efferent nerves thus changing called equilibrium point flexor muscle elbow joint system
An overview arrangement reveals global postures limb position commanded feedforward terms using global displacements common coding forces needed computed locally feedback loops
This method sensorimotor unit governance based upon Anatol Feldman calls equilibrium Point theory formally equivalent servomechanism car cruise control

In artificial intelligence cognitive science structure mapping engine SME implementation software algorithm analogical matching based psychological theory Dedre Gentner
The basis Gentner structure mapping idea analogy mapping knowledge one domain base another target
The structure mapping engine computer simulation analogy similarity comparisons As projects used Falkenhainer
R M
French said structure mapping theory unquestionably influential work date modeling analogy making The theory useful ignores surface features finds matches potentially different things representational structure
For example SME could determine pen like sponge involved dispensing liquid even though differently
Structure mapping theory Structure mapping theory based systematicity principle states connected knowledge preferred independent facts
Therefore structure mapping engine ignore isolated source target mappings unless part bigger structure
The SME theory goes map objects related knowledge already mapped
The theory also requires mappings done one one means part source description map one item target part target description mapped one part source
The theory also requires match maps subject target arguments subject target must also mapped
If conditions met mapping said structurally consistent
Concepts SME SME maps knowledge source target
SME calls description dgroup
Dgroups contain list entities predicates
Entities represent objects concepts description input gear switch
Predicates one three types general way express knowledge SME
Relation predicates contain multiple arguments predicates entities
An example relation transmit
This relation functor transmit takes three arguments
Attribute predicates properties entity
An example attribute red gear means gear attribute red
Function predicates map entity another entity constant
An example function joules power source maps entity power source onto numerical quantity joules Functions attributes different meanings consequently SME processes differently
For example SME true analogy rule set attributes differ functions cannot match unless higher order match
The difference attributes functions explained section examples
All predicates four parameters
They functor identifies type either relation attribute function
The two parameters determining process arguments SME algorithm
If arguments matched order commutative false
If predicate take number arguments N ary false
An example predicate definition sme defPredicate behavior set predicate relation n ary
commutative
The predicate functor behavior set type relation n ary commutative parameters set true
The predicate part definition specifies one predicates inside instantiation behavior set
Algorithm details The algorithm several steps
The first step algorithm create set match hypotheses source target dgroups
A match hypothesis represents possible mapping part source target
This mapping controlled set match rules
By changing match rules one change type reasoning SME
For example one set match rules may perform kind analogy called literal similarity
another performs kind analogy called true analogy
These rules place domain dependent information added rather analogy process tweaked depending type cognitive function user trying emulate
For given match rule two types rules define applied filter rules intern rules
Intern rules use arguments expressions match hypotheses filter rules identify
This limitation makes processing efficient constraining number match hypotheses generated
At time also helps build structural consistencies needed later algorithm
An example filter rule true analogy rule set creates match hypotheses predicates functor
The true analogy rule set intern rule iterates arguments match hypothesis creating match hypotheses arguments entities functions arguments attributes functor
In order illustrate match rules produce match hypotheses consider two predicates transmit torque inputgear secondgear p transmit signal switch div p Here use true analogy type reasoning
The filter match rule generates match p p share functor transmit
The intern rules produce three match hypotheses torque signal inputgear switch secondgear div
The intern rules created match hypotheses arguments entities
If arguments functions attributes instead entities predicates would expressed transmit torque inputgear gear secondgear gear p transmit signal switch circuit div circuit p These additional predicates make inputgear secondgear switch div functions attributes depending value defined language input file
The representation also contains additional entities gear circuit
Depending type inputgear secondgear switch div meanings change
As attributes one property gear circuit
For example gear two attributes inputgear secondgear
The circuit two attributes switch circuit
As functions inputgear secondgear switch div become quantities gear circuit
In example functions inputgear secondgear map numerical quantities torque inputgear torque secondgear For circuit quantities map logical quantity switch engaged numerical quantity current count divide counter SME processes differently
It allow attributes match unless part higher order relation allow functions match even part relation
It allows functions match indirectly refer entities thus treated like relations involve entities
However next section shows intern rules assign lower weights matches functions matches relations
The reason SME match attributes trying create connected knowledge based relationships thus satisfy systematicity principle
For example clock car inputgear attributes SME mark similar
If would making match clock car based appearance relationships
When additional predicates p p functions results matching p p similar results p p except additional match gear circuit values match hypotheses inputgear gear switch circuit secondgear gear div circuit lower
The next section describes reason detail
If inputgear secondgear switch div attributes instead entities SME find matches attributes
It finds matches transmit predicates torque signal
Additionally structural evaluation scores remaining two matches decrease
In order get two predicates match p would need replaced p demonstrated
transmit torque inputgear gear div gear p Since true analogy rule set identifies div attributes p p div attributes part higher relation match torque signal SME makes match div gear div circuit leads match gear circuit
Being part higher order match requirement attributes
For example div gear div circuit part higher order match SME create match hypothesis
However div function relation SME create match
Structural evaluation score Once match hypotheses generated SME needs compute evaluation score hypothesis
SME using set intern match rules calculate positive negative evidence match
Multiple amounts evidence correlated using Dempster rule Shafer resulting positive negative belief values
The match rules assign different values matches involving functions relations
These values programmable however default values used enforce systematicity principle described Falkenhainer et al
These rules If source target functions order match gets evidence
If orders within match gets evidence evidence
If source target functor match gets evidence source function source relation
If arguments match match gets evidence
The arguments might match pairs arguments source target entities arguments functors never case target entity source
If predicate type matches elements predicate match match gets evidence
If source target expressions part matching higher order match add evidence higher order match In example match p p SME gives match transmit relations positive evidence value others get values
The transmit relation receives evidence value gains evidence rules
The matches get value evidence transmit propagated matches rule
For predicates p p SME assigns less evidence arguments transmit relations functions
The transmit relation gets positive evidence rule longer adds evidence
The match input gear switch circuit becomes
This match gets evidence rule evidence propagated transmit relation rule
When predicates p p attributes rule adds evidence transmit match though functors transmit relation match arguments potential match arguments functions
To summarize intern match rules compute structural evaluation score match hypothesis
These rules enforce systematicity principle
Rule provides trickle evidence order strengthen matches involved higher order relations
Rules add subtract support relations could matching arguments
Rule adds support cases functors match
thereby adding support matches emphasize relationships
The rules also enforce difference attributes functions relations
For example checks give less evidence functions relations
Attributes specifically dealt intern match rules SME filter rules ensure considered rules part higher order relation rule ensures attributes match identical functors
Gmap creation The rest SME algorithm involved creating maximally consistent sets match hypotheses
These sets called gmaps
SME must ensure gmaps creates structurally consistent words one one source maps multiple targets target mapped multiple sources
The gmaps must also support means match hypothesis gmap match hypothesis involve source target items
The gmap creation process follows two steps
First SME computes information match hypothesis including entity mappings conflicts hypotheses match hypotheses might structurally inconsistent
SME uses information merge match hypotheses using greedy algorithm structural evaluation score
It merges match hypotheses maximally structurally consistent connected graphs match hypotheses
Then combines gmaps overlapping structure structurally consistent
Finally combines independent gmaps together maintaining structural consistency
Comparing source target dgroup may produce one gmaps
The weight gmap sum positive evidence values match hypotheses involved gmap
For example source containing p p compared target containing p SME generate two gmaps
Both gmaps weight
Source transmit torque inputgear secondgear p transmit torque secondgear thirdgear p Target transmit signal switch div p These gmaps result comparing source containing p p target containing p
Gmap No
TORQUE SIGNAL INPUTGEAR SWITCH SECONDGEAR DIV TRANSMIT TORQUE INPUTGEAR SECONDGEAR TRANSMIT SIGNAL SWITCH DIV Gmap No
TORQUE SIGNAL SECONDGEAR SWITCH THIRDGEAR DIV TRANSMIT TORQUE SECONDGEAR THIRDGEAR TRANSMIT SIGNAL SWITCH DIV The gmaps show pairs predicates entities match
For example gmap No
entities torque signal match behaviors transmit torque inputgear secondgear transmit signal switch div match
Gmap No
represents combining p p
Gmap No
represents combining p p
Although p compatible p p one one mapping constraint enforces mappings cannot gmap
Therefore SME produces two independent gmaps
In addition combining two gmaps together would make entity mappings thirdgear div conflict entity mapping secondgear div
Criticisms Chalmers French Hofstadter criticize SME reliance manually constructed LISP representations input
They argue much human creativity required construct representations intelligence comes design input SME
Forbus et al
attempted rebut criticism
Morrison Dietrich tried reconcile two points view
Turney presents algorithm require LISP input yet follows principles Structure Mapping Theory
Turney state work immune criticism Chalmers French Hofstadter
In article How Creative Ideas Take Shape Liane Gabora writes According honing theory creativity creative thought works individually considered discrete predefined representations contextually elicited amalgam items exist state potentiality may readily separable
This leads prediction analogy making proceeds mapping correspondences candidate sources target predicted structure mapping theory analogy weeding non correspondences thereby whittling away potentiality
