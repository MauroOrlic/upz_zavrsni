A cognitive computer combines artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms approach attempts reproduce behaviour human brain
It generally adopts Neuromorphic engineering approach
An example cognitive computer implemented using neural networks deep learning provided IBM company Watson machine
A subsequent development IBM TrueNorth microchip architecture designed closer structure human brain von Neumann architecture used conventional computers
In Intel announced version cognitive chip Loihi available university research labs
Intel Qualcomm others improving neuromorphic processors steadily Intel Pohoiki Beach Springs systems IBM TrueNorth chip TrueNorth neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit produced IBM
It manycore processor network chip design cores one programmable simulated neurons total million neurons
In turn neuron programmable synapses convey signals
Hence total number programmable synapses million
Its basic transistor count billion
Since memory computation communication handled neurosynaptic cores TrueNorth circumvents von Neumann architecture bottleneck energy efficient IBM claiming power consumption milliwatts power density th conventional microprocessors
The SyNAPSE chip operates lower temperatures power draws power necessary computation
Intel Loihi chip Intel self learning neuromorphic chip named Loihi produced perhaps named Hawaiian seamount Loihi offers substantial power efficiency designed human brain
Intel claims Loihi times energy efficient general purpose computing power needed train neural networks rival Loihi performance
In theory would support machine learning training inference silicon independently cloud connection efficient using convolutional neural networks CNNs deep learning neural networks
Intel points system monitoring person heartbeat taking readings events exercise eating using cognitive computing chip normalize data work normal heartbeat
It spot abnormalities also deal new events conditions
The first iteration Loihi chip made using Intel nm fabrication process houses clusters artificial neurons total simulated neurons
This offers around million synapses still rather long way human brain trillion synapses behind IBM TrueNorth around million using cores
Loihi available research purposes among academic research groups USB form factor
Recent developments include core chip named Pohoiki Beach

Criticism There many approaches definitions cognitive computer approaches may fruitful others Specifically critics argue room sized computer like case Watson viable alternative three pound human brain
Some also cite difficulty single system bring many elements together disparate sources information well computing resources
During World Economic Forum experts claimed cognitive systems could adopt biases developers demonstrated case Google image recognition computer vision algorithm identified African Americans unfavorably
