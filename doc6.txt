Nouvelle artificial intelligence AI approach artificial intelligence pioneered Rodney Brooks part MIT artificial intelligence laboratory
Nouvelle AI differs classical AI aiming produce robots intelligence levels similar insects
Researchers believe intelligence emerge organically simple behaviors intelligences interacted real world instead using constructed worlds symbolic AIs typically needed programmed
Motivation The differences nouvelle AI symbolic AI apparent early robots Shakey Freddy
These robots contained internal model representation micro worlds consisting symbolic descriptions
As result structure symbols renewed robot moved world changed
Shakey planning programs assessed program structure broke necessary steps complete desired action
This level computation required large amount time process Shakey typically performed tasks slowly
Symbolic AI researchers long plagued problem updating searching otherwise manipulating symbolic worlds inside AIs
A nouvelle system refers continuously sensors rather internal model world
It processes external world information needs senses required
As Brooks puts world best model always exactly date complete every detail
A central idea nouvelle AI simple behaviors combine form complex behaviors time
For example simple behaviors include elements like move forward avoid obstacles
A robot using nouvelle AI simple behaviors like collision avoidance moving toward moving object could possibly come together produce complex behavior like chasing moving object
The frame problem The frame problem describes issue using first order logic FOL express facts robot world
Representing state robot traditional FOL requires use many axioms symbolic language imply things environment change arbitrarily
Nouvelle AI seeks sidestep frame problem dispensing filling AI robot volumes symbolic language instead letting complex behaviors emerge combining simpler behavioral elements
Embodiment The goal traditional AI build intelligences without bodies would able interact world via keyboard screen printer
However nouvelle AI attempts build embodied intelligence situated real world
Brooks quotes approvingly brief sketches Turing gave situated approach
Turing wrote equipping machine best sense organs money buy teaching understand speak English process would follow normal teaching child
This approach contrasted others focused abstract activities playing chess
Brooks robots Insectoid robots Brooks focused building robots acted like simple insects simultaneously working remove traditional AI characteristics
He created insect like robots called Allen Herbert
Brooks insectoid robots contained internal models world
Herbert example discarded high volume information received sensors never stored information two seconds
Allen Allen named Allen Newell ring twelve ultrasonic sonars primary sensors three independent behavior producing modules
These modules programmed avoid stationary moving objects
With module activated Allen stayed middle room object approached ran away avoiding obstacles way
Herbert Herbert named Herbert A Simon used infrared sensors avoid obstacles laser system collect D data distance feet
Herbert also carried number simple sensors hand
The robot testing ground real world environment busy offices workspaces MIT AI lab searched empty soda cans carried away seemingly goal oriented activity emerged result simple behavior units combining together
Other insectoid robots Other robots Brooks team Genghis Squirt
Genghis six legs able walk rough terrain follow human
Squirt behavior modules stay dark corners heard noise would begin follow source noise
Brooks agreed level nouvelle AI come near complexity real insect raised question whether insect level behavior reasonable goal nouvelle AI
Humanoid robots Brooks recent work taken opposite direction proposed Von Neumann quotations theorists select human nervous system model unrealistically picking complicated object sun little advantage selecting instead ant since nervous system exhibits exceptional complexity
Cog In Brooks decided pursue goal human level intelligence Lynn Andrea Stein built humanoid robot called Cog
Cog robot extensive collection sensors face arms among features allow interact world gather information experience assemble intelligence organically manner described Turing
The team believes Cog able learn able find correlation sensory information receives actions
In long term team wants Cog able learn common sense knowledge
